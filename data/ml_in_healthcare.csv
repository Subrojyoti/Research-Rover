INTRODUCTIONW ITH the advent of sophisticated machine learning(ML) applications in healthcare, from medical imageanalysis to electronic health records processing, we stand onthe cusp of a transformative era in medicine [84], [116],[117], [137], [92]. Despite these advancements, there remainsa significant yet understudied challenge: ensuring fairnessin algorithmic decisions, particularly as they relate to theequitable treatment of diverse patient populations [135].Fairness in healthcare ML refers to the equitable distributionof benefits and burdens across all demographic groups, withManuscript submitted June 17, 2022; date of current version Nov 7, 2023.This work is in part supported by NSF grants IIS-1939716 and IIS-1900990.Qizhang Feng is with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering,Texas A&M University, TX 77843, US (e-mail: qf31@tamu.edu).Mengnan Du is with the Department of Data Science, New Jersey Instituteof Technology, NJ 07102, US (e-mail: mengnan.du@njit.edu).Na Zou is with the Department of Engineering Technology & Industrial Dis-tribution, Texas A&M University, TX 77843, US (e-mail: nzou1@tamu.edu).Xia Hu is with the Department of Computer Science, Rice University, TX77251, US (e-mail: xia.hu@rice.edu).This paragraph will include the Associate Editor who handled your paper.particular attention to historically marginalized communities.It encompasses a range of issues, from the allocation ofhealthcare resources to diagnostic accuracy across differentpatient demographics. Notable instances include genetic testswhere AI models disproportionately misrepresent risks for mi-nority groups [102], and diagnostic discrepancies exacerbatedby incomplete medical records among Black and Hispanicpatients [119]. The Covid-19 pandemic has further highlightedthese disparities, intensifying the urgency to address them [61].Recognizing the potential of ML to either perpetuate ormitigate existing disparities, this survey seeks to fill thecritical gap in the literature by providing a comprehensiveanalysis of fairness-oriented ML strategies in healthcare. Weacknowledge the socio-technical nature of fairness challengesin healthcare ML, which encompasses algorithmic aspects andextends to societal, ethical, and regulatory dimensions. Thissurvey synthesizes insights from previous works, includingthe categorization of fairness problems [112] and solutions,and charts a path forward for equitable ML applications inhealthcare. The commitment to fair and inclusive AI develop-ment is echoed by governmental bodies, such as the NationalInstitutes of Health, through initiatives like AIM-AHEAD andBridge2AI [20].Distinguishing from related reviews. While the domainsof fairness in machine learning and health disparities arewell-researched, their intersection remains nascent. Severalsurveys [112], [33], [57], [136], [31], [115] have attemptedto address fairness problems in machine learning methodsfor healthcare. Yet, a holistic approach that captures both theethical and technical detail is missing in the literature. Thekey point of fair machine learning in healthcare contain bothethical consideration and also technical details. However, Wehave observed that existing works tend to focus on one aspectwhile neglecting the other. For instance, some works [112],[31] discuss fairness from an ethical standpoint but lack adetailed connection with technical mitigation methods andmetrics for fairness in machine learning. Conversely, anotherline of work [136] provides a technical perspective by cate-gorizing fairness metrics and mitigation methods but does notestablish a strong link with the ethical aspects of healthcarefairness. Additionally, some studies [33] focus narrowly ondata shifts and federated learning, while work [115] limits itsscope to fairness in artificial intelligence for medical imaging.Our survey seeks to establish a comprehensive link betweenthe ethical and technical dimensions of fair machine learningin healthcare. Our survey is motivated by the need to bridgethis evident gap, providing a comprehensive perspective thatties together the ethical considerations and technical detailsof fairness in healthcare machine learning. Specifically, ourcontributions are summarized as follows:1) Connect the ethical and technical aspects of fairness inarXiv:2206.14397v3 [cs.LG] 1 Feb 20242 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020healthcare by adopting the concept of distributive justicefrom works [112], [82].

Highlightthe critical gap in current mitigation methods, focusingon the necessity to discuss and analyze their applicabilityto scenarios of equal allocation and equal performance.3) Discuss challenges and opportunities in creating a fairand reliable machine learning ecosystem for healthcare,with an emphasis on the unique aspects of healthcareapplications.The structure of this article is listed as follows. The defini-tion of fairness problems in healthcare is given in Section II.On the basis of this definition, measurements of fairness aregiven in Section III. Then the biases at various stages of modeldevelopment are introduced in Section IV. Similarly, accordingto the same categorization, methods for mitigating fairnessproblems are discussed in Section V. Finally, we highlightthe challenges and opportunities for a fair and trustworthymachine learning healthcare ecosystem based on uniquenessin healthcare applications in Section VI.II. FAIRNESS PROBLEMS IN ML FOR HEALTHCAREBecause of the digitization of medical data collection, wecan now collect large amounts of medical data and developmachine learning algorithms for a variety of medical tasks.First, machine learning models have been used in pioneeringapplications on medical images (e.g., NIH Chest-Xray14,CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and Chest-Xray8 [132], [73], [78],[119]). For example, a large-scale study built a deep neuralnetwork on the NIH Chest-XRay14 dataset and the CheXpertdataset to diagnose various chest diseases [86]. Second, ma-chine learning models have also been applied to the structuredelectronic health record (EHR), which contains informationon demographics, diagnoses, laboratory tests, medications, etc.For instance, a gradient boosting model was used to predictcardiovascular disease risk based on the Stanford Transla-tional Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE8) dataset [101]. Third, advancements in natural languageprocessing (NLP) have greatly enhanced our ability to processunstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, such asclinical narratives, medical examinations, clinical laboratoryreports, surgical notes, and discharge summaries. These NLPmethods facilitate a range of critical tasks including medicalconcept extraction, disease inference, and clinical decisionsupport [35], [142], [100]. Particularly, large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-2 and GPT-3 have demonstrated theirutility in medical question-answering tasks, including thosein pain management domains [111], [22]. The recent surgein conversational language models, exemplified by ChatGPT,underscores their transformative potential in healthcare. Recentstudy evaluates the feasibility of ChatGPT across multipleclinical and research scenarios, showcasing the model’s sub-stantial impact and the breadth of its applications in thehealthcare field [25]. The recent surge in conversational lan-guage models, such as ChatGPT, marks a significant shiftin healthcare technology. Notably, Microsoft’s Azure HealthBot [1] and NHS-LLM [2] represent pioneering applicationsof LLMs in healthcare. These models are designed to assistusers in assessing healthcare needs, particularly when theyare uncertain about the severity of their condition. However,this raises critical fairness considerations, as the algorithms’decision-making processes must account for diverse patientpopulations and their unique healthcare requirements. Thisis crucial to ensure equitable access and outcomes acrossdifferent demographics, thus avoiding exacerbation of existingdisparities in healthcare [25].A. Distributive Justice in Machine learning for HealthcareAlthough the use of machine learning techniques in health-care has been shown to correct clinical inadequacies and in-crease operational efficiency by reducing resource waste [127],various fairness problems have also been raised. The problemof fairness in machine learning methods is reflected in thediscrimination of different groups [61]. For example, state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers werefound to differ in the true positive rate across protectedattributes (e.g., patient gender, age, race, and insurance type)on 14 diagnostic tasks in 3 well-known public chest x-raydatasets [119].Discrimination can be understood as a distributive prob-lem [85]. In studies developed related to machine learningin healthcare, fairness problems often refer to the unequaldistribution of resources such as medical care, clinical servicesand health facilities [58]. Distributive justice is concerned withthe distribution of resources among members of a society, andthe underlying idea of distributive justice theories are distri-bution principles and metrics of justice [82]. The distributionprinciples specify how resources should be distributed [85].The justice metric specifies the type of resources to be allo-cated [82]. In the context of the fairness problem of machinelearning methods in healthcare, resources often refer to themedical services allocated by the system, or the error rate ofthe predictions it gives. Fairness problems can be grouped intotwo categories based on differences in the resources allocated:equal allocation and equal performance [112].1) Equal Allocation: Machine learning models are oftenused to allocate medical supplies such as vaccines, medicinesand organ transplants. Accordingly, fairness problems of ma-chine learning methods in healthcare occur if the modeldetermines that the allocation of resources is not equal betweengroups. For example, a recently published work focused onbuilding models to help determine which patients with chronickidney disease should undergo kidney transplantation. Thestudy found that the model was biased towards black patientsand tended to classify black patients as having more severekidney disease [7]. Another study examined how to effectivelycombat influenza in the early stages of an influenza outbreakFIRST A. AUTHOR et al.: BARE DEMO OF IEEETAI.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 3with minimal vaccine dosing in the early stages of vaccineproduction when production is limited [53]. They found thatthe optimal solution to the model was likely to producea controversial distribution strategy of not distributing anyvaccine to certain subgroups.2) Equal Performance: In some medical situations, machinelearning models are used for medical tasks such as diseasediagnosis, mortality prediction and multi-organ segmentation,etc. Consequently, it would be unfair if the performance andresults of machine learning models are not equally accuratein terms of metrics such as accuracy for patients in differentdemographic groups. A recent study discovered that, despitehaving similar accuracy to board-certified dermatologists, ma-chine learning algorithms used to classify images of benignand malignant moles are less accurate in the diagnostic taskof melanoma on dark skin [5]. Another study analyzes thesex/racial bias in AI-based cine CMR segmentation usinga large-scale database [110]. It is shown that state-of-the-art deep learning models for automatic segmentation of theventricle and myocardium based on cine short-axis CMR hadstatistically significant differences in errors between races.Different healthcare settings require different kinds ofdistributive justice. The various distributive justice optionsmake it extremely difficult for ML models to satisfy allconditions [46], [36]. Thus, suitable metrics are crucial forevaluating the fairness of a machine learning model.III. MEASUREMENT OF FAIRNESSIn the previous section, we introduce the fairness problemsin machine learning for healthcare and categorize them intoequal allocation problems and equal performance problems.Selecting an appropriate fairness metric is critical to measuringthe fairness problem in various healthcare scenarios. In thissection, we first introduce two principles of fairness followingdistributive justice and then summarize the common metricsof fairness that apply to them.To measure the fairness of a given decision algorithm f(·),we define x ∈ Rdx as the nonsensitive features vector andz ∈ Rdz as the sensitive features vector. In most cases, onlyone sensitive feature is considered, so we use z when dz =1. The prediction of the model f(·) with input x as ŷ =f(x), and y is the corresponding ground truth label. In thissurvey, we mainly focus on the binary classification problem,while many works go beyond it into multi-class classificationtask, regression task, segmentation task with their own uniquemetric. Other symbols and definitions can be found in Table I.A. Equal AllocationEqual allocation is suitable in the healthcare setting whenresources should be distributed proportionally to patients inprotected groups. Equal allocation is also applicable when thelabel is historically biased [113]. For example, if historicallyAfrican American women have been sent for such proceduresat unduly low rates, then a ‘correct’ prediction based onhistorical data would underestimate the status of these women.From a computational point of view, it is desirable thatthe decisions made by the model differ as little as possiblebetween the different demographic groups. In the following,we introduce some fairness metrics that follow the principleof equal allocation.• Demographic Parity (DP) is satisfied if a machinelearning algorithm gives equal decision rates for differentdemographic subgroups a and b:P(ŷ = 1 | z = a) = P(ŷ = 1 | z = b), (1)DP can be extended for multi-class classification ap-plication such as image recognition, text categorization,etc [44]:K∑k=1|P(ŷ = k|z = a)− P(ŷ = k|z = b)| = 0, ∀k ∈ [K],(2)where [K] = {1, . . . ,K} indicates K number of classes.An alternative definition can constitute the summationwith a maximum. DP can also be applied to the regressionmodel rather than to the classification model [37]:supt∈R|P(ŷ ≤ t|z = a)− P(ŷ ≤ t|z = b)| = 0. (3)• General Demographic Parity (GDP) [75] extends thedemographic parity on the continuous sensitive attribute:∆GDP = Ez [|E[ŷ | z]− E[ŷ]|] , (4)where E[ŷ | s] is the local average prediction of themodel conditioned on the sensitive attribute, and E[ŷ]is the global prediction average. GDP degenerates intoweighted demographic parity for the categorical sensitiveattribute.• Fairness through Unawareness (FTU) [83] defines analgorithm as FTU fair as long as sensitive attributes arenot used by the decision-making algorithm f(·):P(ŷ | x, z) = P(ŷ | x) (5)FTU will fail even if no sensitive attributes are present inthe data, if a combination of non-sensitive features canact as a proxy for them. For example, an individual’spostal code might be used as a proxy for their income,race, or ethnicity [55].• Fairness through Awareness [51] emphasizes that afair algorithm should make similar decisions for twoindividuals x and x′ with similar non-sensitive attributes:D (f(x), f(x′)) ≤ d (x, x′) (6)Note that the algorithm should satisfy the(D, d)-Lipschitz property.• Counterfactual Fairness [83] is derived from causaltheory. The intuition of counterfactual fairness is that afair algorithm should provide the same decision for areal-world individual and its corresponding one in thecounterfactual world:P[ŷ{z←a} = c | x, z = a]= P[ŷ{z←b} = c | x, z = a](7)Achieving consensus on causal graphs is challengingdue to the complexity of causal structure discovery,4 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020'DWD&ROOHFWLRQ 0RGHO'HYHORSPHQW 0RGHO'HSOR\PHQW0LVVLQJGDWDELDV,QWHUDFWLRQELDV)HDWXUHV /DEHOV7UDLQLQJ'DWD &OLQLFDO'DWD7UDLQLQJ±VHUYLQJVNHZELDV0LQRULW\ELDV$OJRULWKPELDV/DEHOELDVD E F'HPRJUDSKLF*URXS 'HPRJUDSKLF*URXSFig. 1. Bias at the different stages in machine learning systems: Red and blue represent two demographic groups.

Interaction bias occurs patients and healthcare professionals interact with machinelearning models.

Thiscomplexity can lead to the incorrect assumption of causalstructures from statistical model outputs, resulting invarying interpretations and difficulty in standardizingcausal graphs [121].B. Equal PerformanceEqual performance means that a model is guaranteed to beequally accurate for patients in protected and non-protectedgroups. The concept of accuracy can include equal sensitivity(also called equal opportunity [140]), equalized odds, andequal positive predictive value [36], or broader metrics suchas AUC, etc. Equal performance metric is appropriate in thecontext where the accuracy of the machine learning modelis crucial. For instance, the machine learning system can beintroduced to build a monitoring system that is used to alertrapid response teams when hospitalized patients are at highrisk of deterioration [54]. If the predictive model imposes ahigh false positive rate on the protected group, patients in theprotected group may lose the opportunity to be identified,which can have serious consequences. However, forcing amodel’s predictions to have one of the performance charac-teristics of equality [67] may have unintended consequences.For example, the model may achieve equal odds by sacrificingthe accuracy of the unprotected group, which underminesthe benefit principle [133]. In the following, we introducesome fairness measurements that follow the principle of equalperformance.• Equal Opportunity is preferred when people care moreabout true positive rates. We say that a classifier satisfiesFIRST A. AUTHOR et al.: BARE DEMO OF IEEETAI.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 5equal opportunity if the true positive rate is the sameacross the groups [140]:P{ŷ = 1 | y = 1, z = a} = P{ŷ = 1 | y = 1, z = b}.(8)It can also be referred to as positive predictive valueparity. Similarly, there is negative predictive value parity:P{ŷ = 1 | y = 0, z = a} = P{ŷ = 1 | y = 0, z = b}(9)Predictive value parity is also called sufficiency.• Equalized Odds requires that the decision rates acrossdemographic subgroups be the same when their outcomeis the same [27]:P{ŷ = 1 | z = a, y = 0} = P{ŷ = 1 | z = b, y = 0},P{ŷ = 1 | z = a, y = 1} = P{ŷ = 1 | z = b, y = 1}(10)Equalized Odds requires the algorithm to have equal truepositive rates and equal false positive rates at the sametime.• Treatment Equality requires that the ratio of false nega-tives and false positives be the same for subgroups [14]:P(ŷ = 1|y = 0, z = a))P(ŷ = 0|y = 1, z = a))=P(ŷ = 1|y = 0, z = b))P(ŷ = 0|y = 1, z = b)).(11)IV. SOURCES OF FAIRNESS PROBLEMSIn this section, we summarize the causes of fairness prob-lems in healthcare machine learning and use the term ‘bias’ todenote them [98]. The process of building a machine learning-based healthcare system can be divided into three stages.First, the agency collects relevant clinical data for modeldevelopment. Then, developers select and train a suitablemodel for the intended task, based on the data and the typeof task. Finally, the institution involved can license the modelfor implementation in real clinical practice. We present thevarious complex biases that exist in healthcare based on thethree different stages (see the overview in Figure 1).A. Bias in Data CollectionData collection is the first stage at which bias may beintroduced. A machine learning model is trained to fit thedistribution of the training data. When there is bias in the data,the model may perpetuates the bias (as shown in Figure 1.(a)).In the following paragraphs, we review several common typesof data bias in clinical practice.1) Minority Bias: Minority bias occurs when the samplesize of a demographic group is smaller than that of othergroups. The development of machine learning algorithms inhealthcare is currently highly dependent on public biobankdatabases [13], [23]. However, due to the uneven developmentof medical standards, most of the data collection is done inEurope. This has led to the study of human knowledge of thedisease using biobank repositories that mainly represent indi-viduals of European ancestry. For example, the vast majorityof cases in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are made upof whites, representing approximately 82.0% of the cases. Incontrast, a very small proportion of the cases are from black,Asian, and other ethnic minorities [59]. In fact, demographicdata such as ethnicity are crucial to determining the mutationalprofile and mechanisms of cancer. As a result, genetic riskmodels perform worse in ethnic minority populations.2) Missing-data Bias: Missing data bias occurs when datamay be missing in a non-random way. Machine learningalgorithms may cause harm to people with missing data inthe dataset. For example, research has found that vulnerablepeople of low socioeconomic status are likely to be seen in apiecemeal fashion or cannot be seen. If patients are identifiedbased on a certain number of ICD codes, records of the samenumber of visits to several different healthcare systems forthese patients may be missing. Another example is that, despitenumerous initiatives, sexual orientation and gender identityhave been largely absent from electronic health records to date.Machine learning-based clinical decision support systems canmisinterpret the lack of access to care as a lower burden ofdisease and therefore produce inaccurate predictions for thesegroups [33].3) Label Bias: Label bias may also be present in data labels,and the quality of the labels can contribute to bias [112].For example, people with low socioeconomic status maybe more likely to be seen in teaching clinics, where doc-umentation or clinical reasoning may be less accurate orsystematically different from the care provided to patients withhigh socioeconomic status. Algorithms based on these datamay reflect practitioner bias and misclassify patients basedon these factors. The choice of inappropriate labels can alsointroduce bias. For example, some models use specific phrasesthat appear in clinical records as proxy labels that indicatethe presence of cardiovascular disease. However, becausewomen have different symptoms of acute coronary syndromes,proxy phrases have different meanings for men and women.As a result, women can receive delayed care, which causesdiscrimination against women.B. Bias in Model DevelopmentBias in the model development phase can lead to machinelearning models perpetuating or even amplifying existing bi-ases in the data. This can stem from various sources, includinginappropriate intrinsic hypotheses, the structure of the model,and biased loss estimators, all of which can potentially con-tribute to fairness problems [24], [134], [30]. A predominantconcern in this context is algorithmic bias, where the sourceof bias is traceable back to the model itself, systematicallyleading to unfair results for certain groups as depicted inFigure 1.(b).In the discourse of algorithmic fairness, both shortcutlearning and confounding effects epitomize pathways throughwhich machine learning models may inadvertently perpetuatebiases. Shortcut learning occurs when models exploit easybut unreliable correlations to make predictions [21], [12],often bypassing more substantive but complex relationships.For instance, a study shows that models can capture andamplify the association between labels and sensitive attributes,6 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020TABLE IIMITIGATION METHODS CATEGORIZATION.Reference Task Dataset Data TypeData CollectionData RedistributionDiversified Collection[88] Type II Diabetes Risk Prediction eMERGE[97] EHR,Genomic[56] Skin Lesion Classification Skin ISIC 2018[38] Medical ImageData Reweighting[138] Skin Lesion Classification Skin ISIC 2017[65] Medical Image[130] AD Classification ANDI[103] Medical ImageData Resampling [29] Diabetes Classification The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset[122] EHRSynthetic Data[114] Skin Lesion Classification HAM10000[129] Medical Image[15] Mortality Prediction MIMIC-III[77] EHRData Purification[99] Mortality Prediction MIMIC-IV[76] EHR[100] Health Condition Classification n2c2[81], MIMIC-III[77] EHR, Clinical NoteModel DevelopmentModel DesensitizationAdversarial Learning[39] Radiology Findings Identification Private Medical Image[40] ASCVD Classification Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository[93] EHR[18] In Hospital Mortality Prediction, Patient Membership Prediction MIMIC-III[77] EHR, Clinical Note[143] HIV Diagnosis, Morphological Sex Identification, Bone Age Determination HIV Dataset[104],NCANDA dataset[125],Bone-aging Dataset[66] EHR, MRIDisentanglement [18] Appointment No-show Prediction Private EHRContrastive Learning [64] Chest X-ray Classification NIH-ChestXRay8[132] Medical ImageModel Constraint [106] Inpatient Mortality Prediction, Length of Stay Prediction Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository[93] EHRModel DeploymentDecision Explanation [99] In Hospital Mortality Prediction MIMIC-IV[76] EHRModel Adjustment [74] Congestive Heart Failure Prediction MIMIC-CXR[78], CheXpert[73] Medical ImageOutcome Adjustment [105] Ten-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Prediction Optum CDM[3] EHReven in balanced datasets [131]. The learned model mayamplify the association between label and gender, mimick-ing an imbalanced dataset. This is akin to a model usingconfounding variables that correlate with both the input fea-tures and the output labels, thus rendering the predictionsunfair [143], [43], [62]. The recent literature underscores thesimilarity between these phenomena: both are manifestationsof models’ proclivity to capitalize on spurious correlationsrather than causally relevant patterns. Such practices not onlycompromise the equity of the models but also their robustnessand reliability. Confounder-aware approaches and mitigationstrategies, as delineated in seminal works, are therefore criticalin ensuring that machine learning contributes to the fair andjust application of AI in healthcare, and does not inadvertentlyexacerbate existing disparities. Typically, machine learningmodels aim to maximize overall predictive performance on thetraining data. This focus may lead to optimizing for individualsthat occur more frequently, while neglecting underrepresentedgroups due to sampling bias. Consequently, a model mayexhibit superior overall performance but fail to generalize wellfor underrepresented groups [30]. For instance, in the field ofradiology, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have beenfound to exhibit inconsistencies in diagnosis, particularly forunderserved groups such as Hispanic patients and Medicaid re-cipients in the United States, leading to a higher rate of under-diagnosis or misdiagnosis compared to White patients [120].Furthermore, studies suggest that different machine learningalgorithms can exhibit varying degrees of bias when appliedto the same dataset [139]. The study assessed Logistic Re-gression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for their performanceand fairness in healthcare tasks like predicting hospital staysand diagnosing diseases. It highlighted significant variationsin how these algorithms handled sensitive data like race andgender across identical datasets.C. Bias in Model DeploymentA trained machine learning model can be applied to clinicalpractice when it has passed regulatory authorization. Bias islikely to occur at this stage, and there may contain two typesof bias (as shown in Figure 1(c)).1) Training–serving Skew Bias: The training service skewbias is due to the fact that the data distribution encountered bythe model in the deployment environment is different from thedata distribution at the time of training. This phenomenon isknown as the distributional shift [33], [123]. During modeltraining, a strong assumption is that the training and testdatasets are drawn independently and exactly from the samedistribution (i.i.d.). This can lead to fairness problems whenthe model is deployed, even if it satisfies the notion of fairnessin the training dataset. The phenomenon of distributionalshift can occur with racially skewed public biobank datasets,which has a differential impact on ethnic subpopulations.For example, the first AI model to surpass clinical rank inpredicting lymph node metastasis was trained and evaluatedon the CAMELYON16/17 dataset, which is unique to theNetherlands [13], [72]. In addition to changes in ethnicity inthe population, changes in medical equipment, such as imagecapture and biometrics, can also lead to bias. For example, inradiology, there may be differences in radiation dose that affectthe signal-to-noise ratio of the images obtained. In pathology,there is also a great deal of heterogeneity in tissue preparation,staining protocols, and specific scanner camera parameters,which has been shown to affect model performance in cancerdiagnostic tasks [33], [26]. Data sets may also change inresponse to technological developments or changes in humanbehavior. A typical example includes the migration of ICD-8 toICD-9 [70]. Another example is the discontinuation of the Epicsepsis model (ESM) due to changes in patient demographicsas a result of COVID-19 [33].Most of the work has focused on short-term learning ofFIRST A. AUTHOR et al.: BARE DEMO OF IEEETAI.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 7fairness classifiers, and there has been few research on theanalysis of fairness metrics under temporal or spatial datasettransfer. One work [118] uses a causal framing help diagnosefailures of fairness transfer.2) Interaction Bias: This type of bias arises from theinteraction of the model with its users. On the one hand,protected groups may distrust a model’s predictions in lightof a history of exploitation and unethical behavior, believingthat the model is biased against them. This is also referredas informed mistrust bias [61]. On the other hand, clinicianscan also place too much trust in machine learning models andinappropriately act on inaccurate predictions, which can becalled automation bias [112].V. MITIGATION OF FAIRNESS PROBLEMSA variety of approaches have been developed to addressfairness concerns in machine learning applications within thehealthcare domain. These methods can be categorized based onthe stage of the machine learning life cycle at which they areapplied. We delineate these approaches across three key stages:data collection, model development, and model deployment.Furthermore, we meticulously align the motivations behindeach mitigation method with the sources of bias identified inthe previous section, providing a cohesive overview of howthese strategies correspond to specific biases encountered inthe machine learning pipeline. Table II presents a taxonomyof mitigation methods utilized in the domain of fair machinelearning for healthcare, detailing the specific tasks, datasets,and data types to which they are applied.A. Mitigating Fairness Problems in Data CollectionData bias can be transferred and embedded in machinelearning models. Therefore, we can mitigate fairness problemsduring the data collection phase. These methods are dividedinto two groups, data redistribution methods and data purifi-cation methods.1) Data Redistribution: Data distribution discrepancies, asdiscussed in Section IV-A, often lead to fairness problems inmachine learning models. For instance, minority bias arisesfrom the imbalanced data of different demographic groups,while missing data bias emerges due to the uneven distributionof unseen data. Several data redistribution techniques aim torectify these imbalances, including diversified collection, datareweighting, data resampling, and data synthesis.a) Diversified Collection: While the direct collectionof more diverse data is a straightforward solution, practicalchallenges like patient privacy and data collection costs oftenhinder such efforts. Federated learning offers a solution byenabling model training across multiple decentralized datasetswithout directly sharing the data [33], [88]. An instance ofthis is Swarm Learning (SL) which, when evaluated on theSkin ISIC 2018 dataset, exhibited enhanced fairness comparedto centralized training [56]. However, federated learning doesnot guarantee balanced data.b) Data Reweighting: By assigning importance weightsto training data, reweighting adjusts for data distributionimbalances. Applications of reweighting are seen in skin lesionclassification and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis [138], [130].A notable drawback is that models trained with weightedsamples might lack robustness, leading to estimator variance.c) Data Resampling: Resampling rectifies underrepresen-tation by adjusting the sub-samples of the original dataset.Techniques like SMOTE combine oversampling of minoritygroups with undersampling of majority ones, proving ben-eficial in tasks like heart failure survival prediction [29].However, such methods may reduce the diversity of datacharacteristics.d) Synthetic Data: Synthetic data, often generated usingalgorithms like GANs, can enhance data distribution [126],[114]. By imposing fairness constraints during the generationprocess, biases in synthetic data can be controlled.Synthetic data alleviates data privacy and cost concerns [15],consistent with HIPAA’s stipulations [52]. It generates de-identified datasets that preserve statistical properties withoutrevealing personal health information (PHI), thus supportingHIPAA’s objective to protect patient privacy. Federated learn-ing enhances this by allowing institutions to collaborativelytrain models while each entity maintains control over its PHI,a process in harmony with HIPAA’s privacy and security rules.2) Data Purification: Data purification approaches aim tomitigate fairness problems by adjusting data features or labels,often by addressing biases related to sensitive attributes.a) Removing Sensitive Attributes: A common intuitionin data purification is to remove sensitive attributes from thedataset, a method known as fairness through unawareness.However, this approach has limitations, as protected attributescan still be inferred from other features or their combinations,which act as proxy variables correlating with protected groupmembership [99].b) Mitigation in Language Models: In the realm ofNatural Language Processing (NLP), data purification hasbeen explored for clinical notes. One study [100] quantifiedthe “genderedness” of n-grams in clinical notes using cosinesimilarity between word vectors generated by BERT-baseand Clinical BERT word embeddings [45], [10]. The mostbiased n-grams were then identified using rank perturbationdispersion (RTD) and subsequently removed from the clinicalnotes [47].c) Addressing Label Bias: Label bias, which occurs whenlabels in the dataset are biased, represents another challenge.Data massaging tackles this by changing the labels of someobjects in the dataset [79]. This method’s application inhealthcare remains an area yet to be explored.B. Mitigating Fairness Problems in Model DevelopmentAs discussed in Section IV-B, algorithmic bias duringthe model development stage can result in machine learningmodels that inherit and potentially amplify biases, leading tofairness problems. Two key drivers of this bias are identified:first, shortcut learning, where models rely on sensitive infor-mation for predictions; and second, optimization processes thatfail to generalize for underrepresented groups.8 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020'LYHUVLILHGFROOHFWLRQ 5HZHLJKWLQJ 5HVDPSOLQJ 6\QWKHWLFD'DWD5HGLVWULEXWLRQ2ULJLQDO'DWDVHW6HQVLWLYH$WWULEXWH.HULWLVD\R0DOHZKRZDV UHFHQWO\ DGPLWWHG WRWKH (' IRU VXGGHQVWXIILQJ OHDN 7KH UHSDLUWRKLVVWLFNLQJVHHPVWREHKROGLQJZHOO+HKDVDFRRODQG IULHQGO\ GLVSRVLWLRQDOWKRXJK KH GLG FRPSODLQDERXW WKH GLIILFXOWLHV RIEHLQJJUHHQKHVKH0DOHKLPZRPDQXWHULQHIHPDOE'DWD3XULILFDWLRQFig. 2. An illustration of methods mitigating the fairness problem in data collection stage: (a) Data redistribution methods adjust the distribution ofthe data. The diversified collection method collects data from other hospitals. The reweighting method assigns the weights to minority data. The resamplingmethod seeks to create fair training samples in the sampling strategy. The synthetic method generates fake data. (b) Data purification methods remove sensitiveinformation directly from the data. For example, removing sensitive attributes from tabular data or removing gender-specific pronouns from textual data.To address these issues, we introduce two categories ofapproaches to mitigate fairness problems during the modeldevelopment stage: model desensitization and model con-straint. Model desensitization involves techniques that reducea model’s reliance on sensitive attributes, thereby preventing itfrom making biased predictions based on those attributes. Onthe other hand, model constraint methods impose restrictionson the model training process to ensure fair treatment of allgroups, especially those underrepresented in the training data.1) Model Desensitization: Model desensitization focuseson preventing models from retaining or utilizing sensitiveattribute information from the data. Simply removing sensitiveattributes from the data features is not a failproof solution,as machine learning models have shown the capability todifferentiate sensitive information even in their absence [89],[80]. To effectively mitigate fairness problems, model desensi-tization approaches such as adversarial learning, representationdisentanglement, and contrastive learning aim to eliminate themodels’ ability to discriminate based on sensitive information.Adversarial learning is a widely used method to debias amodel. Specifically, the goal of adversarial learning is to allowthe model to complete downstream tasks while not predictingsensitive attributes. Adversarial learning is first introducedin Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [63] and thenapplied to fair machine learning [96]. Adversarial learninggenerally contains two branches: one is for downstream tasks,while the other is to remove sensitive attribute information:minθmaxϕL(D; θ) + Ladv(D;ϕ), (12)where D is the training dataset. θ is the parameter forthe downstream task and ϕ is the parameter for adversarialclassification. L is the normal object function and Ladv is theadversarial object function that indicates the error in predictingsensitive attributes. Adversarial learning is applied to debias amodel for the diagnosis of chest X-ray and mammograms [39].The authors use CNN with two branches, where one predictsthe classification target and the other predicts the sensitiveattributes. The training has two steps. The first step minimizesthe loss for both branches. In the second step, a flipped signgradient of adversarial branch is backpropagated, with theaim of suppressing learning of protected variables. Similarstrategy is used to reduce the confounding effect from sensitiveattribute [143]. In addition to the use cases for medical imagedata, adversarial learning has also been used to build fairmachine learning models that can handle EHR data and textualdata [107], [142].Some other model desensitization approaches have beenproposed in the context of general fairness problems instead ofhealthcare. The disentanglement method assumes that the en-tangled information from the input space could be disentangledin the latent embedding space. To make downstream tasks fair,the disentanglement method separates and removes sensitiveinformation from the latent embedding space. Existing workhas explored the use of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) toachieve group and subgroup fairness with respect to multiplesensitive attributes [40], [18]. The contrastive learning methodprojects the input data into the latent space and encouragesdata points with various sensitive attributes to be close inthe latent space and data points with the same sensitiveattributes to be scattered. Some work has explored the useof contrastive learning methods to debias the pre-trained textencoder [34], image encoder [64], or to remove the effect ofgender information on self-supervised embedding [128].2) Model Constraint: Addressing another potential driver ofalgorithmic bias—namely, the failure of the optimization goalto generalize to underrepresented groups—model constraintFIRST A.

An illustration of methods mitigating the fairness problem in model development stage: (a) Model desensitization removes the ability ofthe model to discriminate between sensitive attribute information. Adversarial learning disables the model of predicting sensitive attributes. Disentanglementmethod separates and removes the sensitive attribute information from latent embedding. Contrastive learning enforces the samples with various sensitiveattributes to be close in latent space. (b) Model constraint methods add additional constraints or regularization term.methods take a direct approach. Unlike model desensitizationmethods that implicitly debias the model, model constraintmethods mitigate fairness problems by explicitly incorporatingconstraints into the optimization goal.This often involves adding fairness-specific optimization ob-jectives. For instance, these objectives might directly improvefairness metrics [6] or include regularization terms to enforcenon-discrimination principles or counterfactual fairness [106].One notable approach involves developing an augmentedcounterfactual fairness criterion to reduce biases in ElectronicHealth Record (EHR) data. This method requires the machinelearning model to make consistent predictions for a patientand a counterfactual version of the patient after alteringthe sensitive attribute. The optimization objective functioncomprises three components: prediction losses for factual andcounterfactual samples, and an additional regularization termdesigned to meet the proposed fairness criteria [60].Despite their direct approach to addressing fairness, modelconstraint methods are not without drawbacks. It has beenobserved that stringent optimization constraints can sometimesreduce predictive performance. Moreover, the impact of reg-ularization strength on fairness metrics can vary, presentingchallenges in balancing performance and fairness.C. Mitigating Fairness Problems in Model DeploymentDeploying machine learning models in clinical settingsoften surfaces biases not apparent during training or test-ing. Constructing entirely unbiased models from the outsetis challenging and resource-intensive. Thus, post-deploymentmitigation strategies are essential for addressing biases as theyemerge. This section explores three key methods: decisionexplanation, model adjustment, and outcome adjustment, eachaddressing specific biases such as interaction bias and training-serving skew bias.1) Decision Explanation: Fairness in deployed machinelearning systems is not solely a technical challenge but asocio-technical one, where human interaction with the modelis pivotal. Interaction bias, as delineated in Section IV-C2,contributes to unfair outcomes during deployment. To mitigatesuch biases, the application of explainable artificial intelli-gence (XAI) is crucial, enabling users to understand andappropriately trust the model’s decisions.XAI can demystify model predictions, which is criticalwhen balancing the trust in an algorithm’s decisions against therisk of perpetuating unfairness. It is particularly important inhealthcare, where decisions have profound implications. Forinstance, studies have shown that demographic features candisproportionately influence algorithmic decisions, potentiallyleading to differential treatment across patient groups [99].XAI techniques have revealed such biases by highlightingthe varying importance of sensitive attributes across differentdemographics.Conversely, mistrust in fair models can also undermine theirutility, prompting patients to eschew treatments or withholdinformation [48], [112]. Addressing this, research indicatesthat clear explanations of model decisions can foster trust both10 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020F2XWFRPH$GMXVWPHQWE0RGHO$GMXVWPHQWD'HFLVLRQ([SODQDWLRQFig. 4. An illustration of methods mitigating the fairness problem in model deployment stage: (a) The decision explanation method offers the explanationto the outcome via XAI tool. (b) The model adjustment method fine-tunes the last few layers of the deployed mode. (c) The outcome adjustment methodadjusts the original outcome to meet fairness requirement.in the system and among medical professionals [4], [71].Ultimately, integrating fairness-oriented knowledge intoXAI methods not only clarifies model decisions but also guidesthe refinement of models to ensure equitable outcomes [50].The synergistic relationship between fairness and explain-ability in machine learning models is an emergent field ofresearch that warrants further exploration, as will be discussedin Section VI-D.2) Model Adjustment: Training-serving skew bias leads tofairness problem since it violates the assumption that data inthe deployment phase are i.i.d. with the data in the trainingphase. The model adjustment method, such as transfer learn-ing, seeks to solve this problem by fine-tuning part of themodel.Since naively retraining the entire model can be expensiveand impossible, transfer learning can provide a simple andeffective way to mitigate the problem [74]. This work proposessolving the shortcut problem where the model relies on simpleand shallow features (e.g. the sensitive attribute) to make thedecision. Specifically, the training pipeline contains two stages.The authors first train the model on a biased dataset. Thenthe model is tuned on a new unbiased dataset with only thelast few layers being fine-tuned. The results show that theproposed approach improves the generalization performancein older people.3) Outcome Adjustment: Outcome adjustment strategies areemployed to enhance fairness for protected groups by alteringthe model’s outputs or decision boundaries [105].Calibration, for instance, aims to align the proportion ofpositive predictions with the actual rate of positive outcomesacross various subgroups [42]. Fairness in this context de-mands that such alignment is maintained across both pro-tected and non-protected subgroups alike [27]. Nevertheless,the challenge arises when calibration efforts confront theincompatibility between different fairness standards. Notably,attempts to calibrate across multiple protected groups oftenfind themselves at odds with criteria like equalized oddsor disparate impact [109]. This conundrum necessitates anuanced approach to calibration, where the trade-offs betweencompeting fairness dimensions are carefully balanced.Thresholding takes a different tack by redefining decisionboundaries. It can be particularly effective in situations wherethe model’s default decision threshold does not accommo-date the protected group adequately. By employing variablethresholds based on sensitive attributes, a model can betuned to fulfill fairness metrics such as equal odds or equalopportunity [68]. For example, applying a lower threshold fora minority group could increase their representation in positivepredictions, aligning with the goal of equal opportunity.Discussion of the applicability of the mitigation method.In this review, we have previously highlighted in Section IIthe need for distinct forms of distributive justice in varioushealthcare settings, specifically equal allocation and equalperformance. And it is important to note that simultaneouslyachieving these fairness constraints can be challenging [98].Only few of existing literature on mitigation methods studytheir applicability to different measures of fairness metric. Forexample, the model constraint approach [6] offers flexibilityin satisfying either equal allocation or equal performance, asthe fairness constraint can be incorporated as an optimizationobjective. Recent studies have also demonstrated the effec-tiveness of certain model desensitization methods in ensuringeither equal allocation or equal performance through appro-priate optimization. For instance, some work [96] proposedthe use of adversarial objects to achieve demographic parityand equalized of odds. However, the previous two work arein the field of general fair machine learning. Few work onfair machine learning for healthcare discuss the applicabilityof appropriate fairness metrics, which is an obstacle to thedeployment of mitigation methods in real healthcare scenariosand may even exacerbate fairness problems. As a result, weadvocate for additional research efforts to conduct detailedexperiments and discussions on the suitability of differentfairness metrics for different mitigation methods in order toensure their effective implementation in healthcare settings.FIRST A. AUTHOR et al.: BARE DEMO OF IEEETAI.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 11VI. RESEARCH CHALLENGESDespite current progress, there are numerous research chal-lenges that must be addressed before machine learning meth-ods can be used in clinical practice.A. Uncertainty and Fairness in HealthcareMachine learning and probabilistic methods have becomeubiquitous across various domains, with their application inmedical data being particularly critical due to the inherentuncertainty from noise in the data. Capturing and analyzingthe uncertainty in data and models is paramount, more soin high-stakes environments such as clinical settings. In suchcontexts, physicians might leverage the quantified uncertaintyto prioritize manual review of cases that the model deemshighly uncertain. The advent of new deep learning techniqueshas seen a significant rise in addressing such uncertainties [9].Despite this, the interplay between fairness and uncertaintyhas not been explored thoroughly in research.Uncertainty can play a pivotal role in highlighting fairnessproblems within machine learning applications in healthcare[94], [95]. Addressing epistemic uncertainty, which arises fromincomplete knowledge, often involves integrating more datainto the model. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty, whichis inherent and irreducible, demands distinct strategies. Themeasurement and communication of uncertainties are crucialfor identifying potential unfairness in model predictions [16].Incorporating model uncertainty into fairness metrics can pro-vide a more comprehensive view of model performance acrossdifferent groups, ensuring that disparities in prediction confi-dence do not go unnoticed [8]. An understanding of aleatoricuncertainty can lead to models that are inherently fairer,offering improved outcomes for underrepresented groups inthe data [124]. Furthermore, active learning techniques, whichfocus on the selection of diverse and representative dataduring model training, have been proposed as a means topreemptively mitigate bias [19]. There is a clear need forfurther investigation into how uncertainty impacts the fairnessof machine learning models, a step that is crucial for theresponsible deployment of AI in sensitive sectors.B. Long-term Fairness in HealthcareAnother distributive justice called equal outcome or equalbenefit is not mentioned in Section II-A. It refers to theassurance that protected groups have the same benefit fromthe deployment of machine learning models. The gap betweenequal allocation and equal benefit occurs when a fair decisioncannot guarantee fair benefit to patients in the future. Mostcurrent research has focused on fairness problems in machinelearning in static classification scenarios and has not examinedhow these decisions will affect the future [69]. It is oftenassumed that unfairness can be improved better after imposingfairness constraints on machine learning models. However, thisis not the case in healthcare settings in practice. Even in a one-step feedback model, ordinary fairness standards generally donot promote improvement over time and may cause harm [91].The key difficulty in alleviating the long-term fairness problemis to simulate the long-term dynamics and predict the futurebenefit [41].Another research challenge is that the healthcare systemis not an isolated system. When machine learning algorithmsare embedded in clinical systems, the diagnostic decisions theymake are collected and combined into new clinical data. Thesedata then have an impact on the performance of future machinelearning algorithms. This is also called a feedback loop. Whenbias appears in the feedback loop, it can exacerbate the biasor create new biases and further compromise the benefit ofcertain demographic groups. A similar feedback loop has beendiscussed in the context of the recommender system [141]. Tothe best of our knowledge, no research has been conductedon the long-term fairness problem in the context of thehealthcare domain. We encourage more work on the long-term fairness of machine learning algorithms in healthcare,in particular on equal benefit and feedback loop fairness inclinical applications.C. Fairness of Multi-modality Model for HealthcareA research question is described as multimodal when it in-cludes multiple data types. The human experience of the worldis multimodal. Multi-modal machine learning aims to buildmodels that can process and correlate information from multi-ple modalities, thus enabling advances in artificial intelligencein understanding the world around us. One of the key drivingforces of the intelligent medical system is the multimodalmethod. The combination of different modalities of healthcaredata, each providing information about a patient’s treatmentfrom a specific perspective, overlays and complements eachother to further improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treat-ment. For example, the visual quest answering task [11]combines computer vision and natural language processing,and the model can answer relevant questions based on medicalimages and clinical notes [90]. However, multimodal modelsface more serious bias and fairness problems than uni-modalmodels, despite improvements in performance [17]. Only afew works have focused on multimodality fairness problemsin healthcare systems [32]. The forms in which bias existsvary across modality data, as do the methods used to mitigateit. As previous work has focused on the fairness problem inuni-modal data, we encourage the discovery and mitigation ofbias in healthcare of multimodal data.D. Ethical Machine Learning in HealthcareThe ethical landscape of machine learning within health-care encompasses pivotal concepts such as fairness, inter-pretability, privacy, robustness, and security. These facets aredeeply intertwined, with their relationships characterized byboth synergy and tension. Fairness in healthcare AI seeksto ensure equitable treatment and outcomes across diversepatient groups. Interpretability contributes to this goal bydemystifying model predictions, thereby fostering trust andenabling the identification of potential biases—critical in aclinical setting [49], [72], [99]. However, the pursuit of fair-ness may inadvertently conflict with privacy, particularly for12 JOURNAL OF IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 00, NO. 0, MONTH 2020underprivileged groups who may suffer disproportionate pri-vacy losses [28]. Conversely, the alliance between robustnessand fairness is more harmonious in healthcare AI. Robustfair training aims to inoculate models against perturbationsthat could skew decision-making, thus safeguarding equitableoutcomes [87]. This is paramount in clinical environmentswhere decisions must remain stable despite data variabilityand adversarial conditions. Furthermore, the convergence ofdifferential privacy and adversarial robustness underscores apromising avenue where privacy-preserving techniques alsofortify models against malicious attacks, a duality of par-ticular relevance to safeguarding sensitive health data [108].Yet, the interplay of interpretability, fairness, robustness, andprivacy in healthcare AI is nascent. Research often probesthese dimensions in isolation, seldom navigating their inter-sections. Given their mutual reinforcement and constraints,an integrated approach is imperative. Advancing multi-facetedethical frameworks that concurrently address these dimensionswill be instrumental in realizing the full potential of AI inhealthcare—delivering models that are not only technicallyproficient but also ethically sound and clinically viable.VII. CONCLUSIONSIn this survey, we have synthesized the existing literatureon the intersection of machine learning and fairness withinhealthcare. Drawing from the foundational work in distributivejustice, we have applied the classification of fairness problemsin healthcare-focused machine learning methods, as identifiedby existing research, into two principal categories: equalallocation and equal performance. This has allowed us tomap the metrics commonly used in fair machine learningto these categories specifically in the healthcare context. Wehave delineated biases according to the three distinct stagesof the machine learning lifecycle: data collection, modeldevelopment, and model deployment. For each stage, wehave discussed targeted mitigation methods and examinedtheir interconnections with the sources of bias they aim toaddress. Our survey reveals a gap in the critical evaluation ofthe effectiveness of these mitigation methods when appliedto healthcare-specific fairness metrics. We underscore thepressing nature of fairness concerns in healthcare machinelearning applications and propose future research directionsthat promise to address these challenges.VIII.

This paper provides a conceptual framework to analyse ML’s potential in the context of healthcare’s complex, multi-faceted setting.

ML has emerged over the last decade as a thoughtful attempt to rethink medical professionalism by doctors and their associations and as a major initiative in reforming and improving healthcare service delivery, quality and safety[1]. However, much of ML’s current discourse and practice has focused on individual doctors’ competences, guided by the introduction of various national and regional ML competency frameworks and associated ML training programmes[2, 3, 4]. Although ML can and does contribute to healthcare transformation and system reform[5, 6, 7], we argue its current focus on individual level competences is both limited and limiting because, like traditional leadership theory in general, it risks emphasizing medicine’s ‘muscular individualism’ of competences, traits and behaviours and ‘one-size-fits-all prescriptions for development[8]. We further contend that understanding and realising ML’s potential warrant a more multi-level and context-specific approach that places ML theory and practice in healthcare’s multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder and multi-levelled perspectives.So, building on a short critique of the extant literature and contemporary changes in healthcare, we have developed a framework that can help practitioners understand and assess ML’s potential impact on transforming different kinds of healthcare systems. Here, we distinguish four levels of analyses, which we call ‘domains’ (Figure 1). These domains represent most, if not all, relevant stakeholders, the multitude of formal regulations, processes, social interactions, and the habitual ways-of-working that govern how daily life in healthcare is constituted. We argue ML has to be understood as one key element of a healthcare ecosystem, which we define as a combination of political, economic and cultural institutions in a region that support transformative healthcare outcomes, where interdependent actors and factors are coordinated in such a way as to enable productive healthcare innovation. Moreover, since ML mirrors one of society’s most esteemed profession’s attempts at ‘reprofessionalization’, its future success will depend on other healthcare ecosystem actors’ capacity to reflect on the(ir) current status quo and seek novel and significant ways forward. Our focus is on the region because within nation states, there are considerable differences on how healthcare and its professions are organized, such as the United Kingdom and United States[56]. Therefore, by developing this framework, we hope to contribute to the theory and practice of healthcare Page 2 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only3reform. We proceed by locating our framework in recent changes in healthcare, outline its theoretical foundations, and then discuss its nature and potential for analysing and advancing ML’s promise.BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEMMedicine’s doctor-centred, hierarchically ordered, professional jurisdictions and primarily monodisciplinary education and enculturation have remained relatively unchanged since the times of Hippocrates of Kos[9, 10]. Accordingly, prototypical identity, status and power arrangements between healthcare professions still characterize much of healthcare’s daily practices[11]. Recently, however, different types of Western healthcare systems are progressively struggling with economic constraints; complex demands of ageing populations; integration of health and social care; implementing information technologies; and more recent innovations such as artificial intelligence[12]. As a consequence, more hybridized forms of healthcare systems have developed, reflecting shifts in patterns of ‘institutional logics’. These logics comprise templates of assumptions, beliefs, rules and practices that guide the interpretations, meanings and actions of various actors in the healthcare field[13, 14, 15]. In healthcare, changes have been triggered by shifting combinations of market, bureaucratic and statist (or political-democratic) logics, which have caused doctors to revisit the traditional medical professional logics that have historically governed national and regional systems of healthcare delivery[15, 16, 17, 18, 56]. Such hybridization, which has led to a questioning of what it means to be a medical professional in increasingly complex healthcare systems, has been an important driving force behind the emergence of doctors’ latest professional guise – that of ‘medical leader’[19]. The ‘promise’ of ML, cloaked in doctors’ emerging role as a ‘leader’, rests in the new non-clinical competencies with which they attempt to answer to growing needs of interdisciplinary (net)working, co-creative innovation and continuous quality improvement[5]. However, doctors are also well-known for their allegiance to professional autonomy, sovereign medical expertise, ‘occupational closure’, and the ‘hidden curriculum’ in educating the profession’s new members[9, 10, 20, 21]. This status quo bias, often found among senior medical professionals, can and does provide significant opposition to hybridization[10].Nevertheless, in theory at least, the emergence of ML has the potential to reform or transform national and regional healthcare ecosystems. But this potential will only be realised if there is a contemporaneous and substantial shifting of the status quo of rules and belief systems of other professions (e.g., allied professionals; healthcare management) and those who regulate and govern healthcare systems and organizations (e.g., policy makers; regulatory Page 3 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only4bodies; boards; professional associations). This seemingly paradoxical and reciprocal ‘stand-off’ is characteristic of the, often puzzling and wicked, challenges that accompany transformational healthcare change. Questions arise, such as: (How) will ML change the nature of our healthcare ecosystems? And, alternatively: (How) can adequate healthcare ecosystem reform instil adequate ML? Or both? Our answers to these questions are rooted in the non-linear and unpredictable character of transformational change, which often lies juxtaposed to the more linear and predictable ways of solution-finding that exemplify our bio-medical traditions.Present-day healthcare ecosystems are the product of different combinations of local actors and local political, economic and cultural factors established over many decades, and in some cases, centuries. Thus, the promise of ML in contributing to healthcare ecosystem reform necessitates a multifaceted, historically and contextually-sensitive approach at various levels to enable sustainable change and shifts in professionals’ position and identities[22]. Such reform is also contingent on inter- and intra-system differences, which suggest that one-size-fits-all practices are unlikely to be universally effective. Thus, customizable strategies are probably required to address various local ecosystem contexts. These comprise differences in how healthcare is funded, in the emphasis placed on healthcare domains - e.g., acute care; primary care; mental healthcare; e-health services; public health; and social care - as well as in the differences found among medical specialties. Differences can also be found at the individual level, with doctors exhibiting very different identity motives and personal traits that shape their willingness and ability to accept ecosystem changes[10]. When considering the potential of ML and its development, these distinctions, including those induced by local organizational culture and professional siloes, suggest contextually-specific sets of needs, demands and (re)solutions. Thus, comprehending the concept of ML as a response to contemporary changes in healthcare ecosystems requires more than just scrutinizing one single profession or viewpoint. Steering transformative processes into advantageous directions (including answering the question of ‘How to unlock the potential of ML?’) warrants a deep understanding of local healthcare ecosystem elements and their dynamics, which we now present in our conceptual framework. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKIn developing a conceptual framework, we attempt to simplify healthcare’s complexity by drawing on Scott’s categorization of organizational life and its links with (re)professionalization[23, 24]. We do so by adopting a representation of four dimensions Page 4 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only5pointing to different levels of analysis. These four domains reflect the fundamental aspects of a healthcare ecosystem, and jointly represent dynamics of the endless sequence of change in the institutional field of healthcare and its professions such as medicine. These domains are: (1) the healthcare ecosystem domain; (2) the professional domain; (3) the organizational domain; and (4) the individual doctor domain (Figure 1). Figure 1 Framework for analysing the potential of medical leadership at various institutional levels***about here***These domains constitute the classifications of various institutional, organizational and professional forces responsible for the (re)creation and sustainment of frames of meaning and professional identities that jointly dictate what happens in daily-life[25]. Furthermore, the conceptual framework encompasses the various (and varying) interdependent actors and factors in a healthcare ecosystem. As we will show, the idea of ML interacts with all four dimensions. In the following paragraphs, we elaborate on our framework by describing the four domains, their interrelatedness and relationship with ML. We conclude with an overview of selected practical tactics and approaches that can further ML, and describe their potential impact, and relevance to the discourse of ML (Table 1).The Healthcare Ecosystem DomainWe propose the Healthcare Ecosystem Domain as our framework’s first and most ‘macro’ level of analysis. In this domain, we argue, more collaborative oriented governance regulations and arrangements are imperative to effective healthcare reform, as well as to unlocking ML’s potential. Experiences from regions that have successfully legislated for large scale reform show this to be a complex and long-term proposition requiring investments and unconventional approaches in (re)engineering at the more ‘macro’ healthcare system-level[50, 51]. To expedite a successful transition from fragmented, siloed and mono-specialist processes towards systems of more flexible and fluid networks, various system-level aspects must be coordinated, such as: legislation; funding structures; accountability regulations; quality schemes; and educational programs. In contrast with changes that follow a one-element-at-a-time implementation approach, such multifaceted realignment of various system-level themes fosters a more Page 5 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only6collective, multi-stakeholder, thus ecosystem-type of reform. Ultimately, an ecosystem-level restructuring also provides a more safe ‘landing strip’ for various healthcare professions, including medicine, in finding a new and more adequate balance between “soft (trust, collaboration) and hard (financial incentives) levers”[52 p:54]. Without such synchronous adaptation of the various elements at the macro-level, existing organizational and professional arrangements will risk a continuation of a status-quo bias and traditional fragmented ways of working[9]. For example, legislating for adequately incentivizing collaborative avenues of change can empower (or, if necessary, oblige) medical, nursing, allied health professions and managers (and their linked regulatory and policy bodies) to co-create related intra- and interprofessional standards, mechanisms, policies and educational schemes in order to sustainably produce innovative ways of working. These effects signify the interrelatedness between the current ecosystem-level domain and the other three domains, which we describe in the next sections.Some regions are investing in forms of intentional collective professional identity ‘re-creation’, for example by implementing planned national clinical leadership programs[5]. Other efforts induce interprofessional collaboration by offering comprehensive and locally tailorable interprofessional teamwork curricula (e.g. TeamSTEPPS[40]). Using regional-level endorsed initiatives, governmental agencies encourage local change and institutional entrepreneurship in a non-formative and co-creative way. This also generates and elevates visible ‘hot spots’ experimenting and role-modelling promising new approaches. Moreover, these tactics support (e.g., regional) directorates in gradually introducing well-evidenced interventions that assist local, field-level change ‘champions’, in particular doctors enacting effective ML. Such top-down endorsement of bottom-level ‘proven’ and peer-supported initiatives can be inspirational, in particular to doctors.Lastly, we believe that doctors are better placed than many other actors to play an important role in leading at the healthcare ecosystem level because of their education and training. Their analytic capabilities, combined with knowledge of health, disease, treatment and care-processes, as well as their subjective position in allegiance creation, provide indispensable capabilities for reconstructing ways of working[24 p:28]. However, while having the skill, they may lack the will because their powerful positions and professional socialization can also result in significant status-quo bias decision-making regarding significant reform efforts[10][20]. This discrepancy embodies one of the most wicked of challenges in system transformation[53] and represents a further point of tension between the system and professional domains, to which we now turn.Page 6 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only7The Professional DomainHealthcare’s daily routines are influenced through a continuous establishing and redesigning of professional norms, values, identities and behaviours. These dictate what should happen at healthcare’s frontlines[23]. The ideas and identities held by professionals, which serve as their prescriptive, evaluative and obligatory requirements for professional social interactions and behaviours, are also influenced significantly by their professional structures and associations. Therefore, we use the Professional Domain as our second level of analysis, since it entails professional moral, rights, privileges and responsibilities that form doctors’ daily reality, and comprises how they are educated, enculturated and trained throughout their careers and amidst their peers.Increasingly, interprofessional practice and education are acknowledged as promising new routes towards a new collaborative professionalism[33, 34]. As a consequence, demands for interprofessional practices prompt redesign of formal as well as informal ‘rules of the game’ within and between healthcare professions. This includes anticipatory processes to effectively navigate the shifting of roles and responsibilities between professions[35]. Interdisciplinary healthcare teams, for example, incorporate non-hierarchical and non-linear working in their complex and multi-partner settings, through approaches like inclusive interprofessional sense-making and co-creation[15]. Various elements influencing the wished-for re-embedding of modern interprofessional arrangements that accompany these processes reside in this domain[36].Followership theory, which stresses the relationships between leaders and followers[37], has given rise to more distributed or shared leadership models, resulting in a more inclusive leadership concept affecting all professions[28, 38, 39]. With evidence for interprofessional teamwork as a key-determinant for high quality care on the rise, elements that enhance or impede (shared) leadership’s effectiveness in and across interdisciplinary teams is increasingly regarded as critical[30, 40]. Thus, it is no surprise that recent ML competency frameworks firmly emphasize doctors’ ‘soft’ competencies aimed at collaborating with others, for example in multidisciplinary teams[41]. Inevitably, there is a growing need for new interprofessional principles and arrangements that exceed ancient mono-disciplinary paradigms in healthcare’s education and practice, which have characterized healthcare’s archetypical doctor-nurse dyadic nature for centuries[42]. These changes, we argue, require medical professional bodies in particular, but also policymakers and regulators, educational institutions, healthcare organizations and many other bodies to rethink various aspects of 21st Century’s Page 7 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only8healthcare professionalism for the benefit of their pluriform constituencies and the public at large. These proposed changes demonstrate the relatedness between the Healthcare Ecosystem and Professional Domain as well as our next domain reflecting perspectives of healthcare services delivery: the 24/7 challenge of adequately synthesizing various professional activity that constitutes healthcare, scaffolded by appropriate resourcing and management.The Organizational DomainIn the global pursuit for value-based and integrated care, day-to-day healthcare operations increasingly rely on smooth interdepartmental and organization networking[43]. Also, the quality, timeliness, inclusiveness and safety of contemporary healthcare services are gradually built on more intense interprofessional ‘relational coordination’ (i.e., sharing values; being respectful and trusting; communicating more accurately, frequently and timeously)[44], while the once widely-separated siloes of social care systems, healthcare organizations, and various community-based services are rushing to deliver on their collective responsibility for citizens’ seamless care[43]. This new organizational perspective, focusing on the region where newly-constituted ‘service users’ (rather than patients) live, work and meet with professionals, digitally or physically, requires a divesting of the old ways of working. Here, ML’s explicit focus on more collaborative forms of practice and innovation holds a promise of facilitating such wide-ranging integration. Moreover, doctors are well-positioned as change agents for having “first-hand experience of the work under consideration”, being “trusted by fellow-workers (and patients)” and providing “to the organization of work a flexible, immediate, policy-oriented dynamism and pragmatic adaptability”[45 p:87].However, realizing effective integrated care at an ecosystem level involves dealing with complex transformational change issue and the corresponding “diffuse unreliability, aversion to responsibility, rigid authoritarianism, rule-resistant incompetence and paternalism” associated with it[45 p:87]. A variety of researchers and practitioners have reported on the significance of creating a local receptive context for change as a prerequisite for such reforms[46, 50, 51]. This action decrees wise investments as well as role-modelling effective leadership at all organizational levels, including board, executive, clinical and managerial. Scholars also suggest that organizations and their executives have to devote considerable time and resources for adequate change management and infrastructures to implement new practices[47, 48, 49]. Eventually, organizations, regulators, managers and doctors who consider promoting ML as a cornerstone of forming modern regional care networks, are advised to create learning organizations that “adapt better to rapid environmental change and implement quality Page 8 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only9improvement practices more quickly”[49 p:287]. Incidentally, such transformative settings also provide excellent practice-based learning opportunities, essential to medical and other leadership development: a two-sided sword of organizations’ investments in their ‘social capital’[4, 9, 45]. The overarching aim and corresponding expectation is that contemporary top-down endorsed, middle-management enhanced and bottom-up co-created healthcare transformation will encompass improvement of organizational performances in various hard and soft dimensions[26, 27], which also requires individual doctors to have a strong voice in how they are led and how change is navigated. This focus on voice presages our fourth and last domain.The Individual Doctor DomainThe Individual Doctor Domain echoes Scott’s institutional ‘cultural-cognitive’ dimension of individuals and groups that, often unconsciously, agree upon various social as well as ‘unwritten’ aspects of their institutional life[23]. It is in this domain, that daily reality is reflected; in other words: what actually happens in work life. It is also at this level that doctors are being increasingly challenged to justify their position, status and knowledge sovereignty in healthcare and society. Patients and other stakeholders demand more time and attention, while bureaucratic accountability processes, intensified communication and information exchange within ever expanding interprofessional networks contribute to doctors’ fatigue and burn-out[26, 27]. As a result, doctors have responded variously to these pressures, for example, through opposition, reluctance or willing acceptance to change or by taking up hybrid managerial-clinical functions and, ultimately, by incorporating ML in their professional repertoire of competencies and identities[10, 20]. Thus, growing numbers of doctors participate in ML competency trainings, offered at various stages during their careers [17, 28, 29]. Furthermore, new competency frameworks provide them generic taxonomies and a first generation of ML competency assessment tools supports benchmarking and monitoring of their ML proficiency and development efforts[20, 30].Despite ML’s appealing intentions, however, its emergence is accompanied by various forms of resistance and ambiguity at the individual doctor level. First, ML can generate negative emotions among some doctors, because they doubt the motivations of those peers who occupy or aspire to formal leadership positions[20]. Doctors enacting managerial leadership are sometimes seen as ‘heretics’, ‘crossing lines in the sand’ or going to the ‘dark side’[1, 10]. Additionally, doctors often perceive competency frameworks as utopian, rendering them as super-professionals or as ‘Jacks-of-all-trades’ and deflecting them from their primary role of Page 9 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only10providing patient care[31, p1]. Thirdly, many clinicians see ML education as an unwelcome extra burden onto their already overloaded clinical work as well as obligations in continuous education and revalidation. Finally, ML encourages doctors at times to take a ‘back seat’ or share leadership with other clinical professions[15]. To some doctors these are awkward and unwelcome new propositions, especially among those at later stages in their career[28].Arguably, the design, planning and delivery of ML training, often hosted by professional associations or ‘in house’ by healthcare organizations[3, 4, 6, 32], need to reflect on such contestations. These also need to take into account that generic or one-size-fits-all approaches can be inappropriate at the level of individual doctors. To be effective, ML development activities should be adequately tailored to the perspectives of doctors’ specialties, varying from clinical setting (e.g., geography; payment structure; clinic size; population), medical specialty, career stage, experiential repertoire, to their individual traits and personal needs and interests. Ultimately, the often relatively time-consuming, hence highly-resourced and expensive ML development activities will gain greater legitimacy when well-aligned with the individual, but also when rooted in high levels of regional healthcare ecosystem appropriateness[6, 32]. Therefore, we reason, ML development at the individual doctor level is importantly informed by professional, organizational and ecosystem-level perspectives, illuminated in the preceding sections.*** Table 1 about here ***Page 10 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only11Table 1.

More reciprocal interprofessional collaboration can help professions to convene in discussing the abundance of paradoxical issues that characterize current modes of care that see service users as whole people rather than patients to be treated. Despite their historical origins as an elite, sovereign profession with a strong status quo bias, doctors’ extended training and distinct patient-centred views render them capable of understanding and addressing contradictory arguments of clinical and managerial colleagues in shared decision-making and as potential innovators in healthcare ecosystems[10, 54]. This potential for ML to innovate helps counter an over-reliance on bio-medically oriented clinical protocols, policies, managerial enforcements and bureaucracies. Rightly positioned, organised and having identity motives consistent with ecosystem change, doctors who are trained in effective ML could trail-blaze more favourable professional ways of healthcare reform[10,18]. Such ML can produce high degrees of medical engagement, which helps avert the often-disruptive, hence intimidating, changes and tribal reactions that accompany the re-design of interprofessional arrangements and related their logics and jurisdictions. However, doctors also need to be sufficiently supported in rebalancing their extensive patient-focused clinical expertise with such new skills in organizing leadership and improvement in healthcare ecosystems. Therefore, as we have tried to show in our paper, much remains in the hands of others at diverse levels, to facilitate this already overburdened group of medical experts. Ultimately, we contend, unconventional collaboration between the various stakeholders represented in the four domains, can prevent doctors’ new cloak of ML from evolving into an undesirable ‘Trojan horse’ of a professional reclaiming of traditional institutional position, sovereignty and status quo bias.In this paper we extend the scope of ML beyond individual doctors’ training and performance in their relatively new role of ‘leader’[2]. Explaining ML from four different, yet interrelated, viewpoints, we provide a framework that helps explain impediments in healthcare ecosystem reform that often sprout from deeply rooted medical professional embeddedness. Moreover, as we exemplified in Table 1, the framework helps identifying (often less-conventional) ways to mitigate those barriers, for example through collaborative, multi-level and multi-stakeholder approaches that overarch existing principles[52, 55].Page 12 of 44https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/bmjleaderBMJ Leader123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960Confidential: For Review Only13Our framework is not a universalistic recipe: it is intended as a ‘thinking model’ for all healthcare’s stakeholders to distinguish and rethink their individual, vastly changing, positions and enactments amidst their colleagues in local settings and in regard to other related groups or bodies. Central to this framework, we position the recently-emerged concept of leadership of the medical profession, which we find currently trail-blazing by redefining its professional identity[10]. In doing so, we propose medicine could be seen as role-modelling for other professions’ agentic work and stimulating their non-medical colleagues to also courageously start or proceed in exploring their leadership potential. As we have tried to lay out above, those at the highest managerial, political and administrative positions could follow these trails by finding unconventional collaborative ways of governance and management. In return, this could facilitate other actors in the pluralistic field of healthcare, such as educationalists, administrators, legislators, management, directorates, coaches as well as doctors in taking up leadership to co-create well-aligned new ways of providing healthcare to our patients. CONCLUSIONSThe logics that regulate tomorrows’ healthcare are created while we work, re-think and re-create todays’ routines. Attempts to steer this eternal process more deliberately are a difficult as well as a responsible task for all involved in healthcare service delivery, governance and management. We acknowledge that health systems and settings vary greatly, which is why we have used the regionally-focused healthcare ecosystems perspective. In so doing, we hope this paper contributes to reform efforts, for example by using our framework to differentiate between the various elements and stakeholders that reflect healthcare’s complex, systemic nature. Unlocking the potential of ML, alike many other new concepts that arise during times of transformation, requires bold thinking and acting, daring entering new territories and creating new structures. Moving away from “relatively narrow, single-levelled programmatic change strategies”[49 p:282] towards multi-level and multi-stakeholder ecosystem reform, could offer us leverage for wise creations from which our service users will benefit.Acknowledgements: We thank Celeste Wilderom for her comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

INTRODUCTIONWe are living in the age of algorithms, in which machinelearning (ML)/deep learning (DL) systems have transformedmultiple industries such as manufacturing, transportation, andgovernance. Over the past few years, DL has provided stateof the art performance in different domains—e.g., computervision, text analytics, and speech processing, etc. Due tothe extensive deployment of ML/DL algorithms in variousdomains (e.g., social media), such technology has becomeinseparable from our routine life. ML/DL algorithms arenow beginning to influence healthcare as well—a field thathas traditionally been impervious to large-scale technologicaldisruptions [1]. ML/DL techniques have shown outstandingresults recently in versatile tasks such as recognition of bodyorgans from medical images [2], classification of interstitiallung diseases [3], detection of lungs nodules [4], medicalimage reconstruction [5], [6], and brain tumor segmentation[7], to name a few.It is highly expected that intelligent software will assistradiologists and physicians in examining patients in the nearfuture [8] and ML will revolutionize the medical research andpractice [9]. Clinical medicine has emerged as a exciting appli-cation area for ML/DL models, and these models have alreadyachieved human-level performance in clinical pathology [10],radiology [11], ophthalmology [12], and dermatology [13].Email:aalfuqaha@hbku.edu.qaSome of these studies have even reported that DL modelsoutperform human physicians on average. The aspect of betterperformance of DL models in comparison with humans has ledto the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems—forinstance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in2018 has announced the approval of an intelligent diagnosissystem to detect certain diabetes-related eye problems frommedical images that will not require any human intervention.1The potential of ML models for healthcare applications isalso benefitting from the progress in concomitantly-advancingtechnologies like cloud/edge computing, mobile communi-cation, and big data technology [14]. Together with thesetechnologies, ML/DL is capable of producing highly accuratepredictive outcomes and can facilitate the human-centered in-telligent solutions [15]. Along with other benefits like enablingremote healthcare services for rural and low-income zones,these technologies can play a vital role in revitalizing thehealthcare industry.Notwithstanding the impressive performance of DL algo-rithms, many recent studies have raised concerns about thesecurity and robustness of ML models—for instance, Szegedyet al. demonstrated for the first time that DL models are strictlyvulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial examples [20].Similarly, various types of data and model poisoning attackshave been proposed against DL systems [21] and differentdefenses against such strategies have been proposed in theliterature [19]. However, the robustness of defense methodsis also questionable and different studies have shown thatmost of the defense techniques fail against a particular attack.The discovery of the fact that DL models are neither securenor robust hinders significantly their practical deployment insecurity-critical applications like predictive healthcare which isessentially life-critical. For instance, researchers have alreadydemonstrated the threat of adversarial attacks on ML-basedmedical systems [22], [17]. Therefore, ensuring the integrityand security of DL models and health data are paramount tothe widespread adoption of ML/DL in the industry.Before moving further, we will elaborate upon the two keyterms on which this survey is focused—namely, security androbustness—particularly in the context of ML/DL models.Security is concerned with the possible threats/attacks thatcan be realized on an ML/DL system influencing it to get1https://tinyurl.com/FDA-AI-diabetic-eyeThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

On theother hand, robustness is also analyzed along two axes: (a)the survivability of ML/DL systems under attacks attemptingto influence them (i.e., robustness to attacks like adversarialML attacks); (b) the resistance to privacy attacks. Note thatthe robustness is a relative term and the effectiveness of thesystem varies according to the nature of the attack, i.e., anML/DL system might be robust under a particular attack butvulnerable to a different attack.In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existingliterature on the security and robustness of ML/DL modelswhen used for building healthcare systems with a specificfocus on the above-mentioned dimensions. We note here thatthe aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth survey ofvarious security challenges associated with the application ofML/DL in healthcare systems and to provide a taxonomyof potential solutions to overcome these issues. Along withdiscussing security and robustness challenges of using ML/DLmodels, we also briefly elaborate on various general challengesand sources of vulnerabilities that hinder the safe and robustapplication of ML/DL in healthcare applications. In addition,potential solutions to address security, privacy, and robustnesschallenges are presented in this paper.

ML in Healthcare: The Big PictureThe major phases for developing a ML-based healthcaresystem are illustrated in Figure 1 and major types of ML/DLthat can be used in healthcare applications are briefly describednext.1) Unsupervised Learning: The ML techniques utilizingunlabelled data are known as unsupervised learning methods.Widely used examples of unsupervised learning methods area clustering of data points using a similarity metric anddimensionality reduction to project high dimensional data tolower-dimensional subspaces (sometimes also referred to asfeature selection).

Classicalexamples of unsupervised learning methods in healthcareinclude the prediction of heart diseases using clustering [24]and prediction of hepatitis disease using principal componentanalysis (PCA) which is a dimensionality reduction technique[25].2) Supervised Learning: Such methods that build or mapthe association between the inputs and outputs using labeledtraining data are characterized as supervised learning methods.If the output is discrete then the task is called classificationand for a continuous value output, the task is called regres-sion. Classical examples of supervised learning methods inhealthcare include the classification of different types of lungdiseases (nodules) [4] and recognition of different body organsfrom medical images [2]. Sometimes, ML methods can beneither supervised nor unsupervised, i.e., where the trainingdata contains both labeled and unlabelled samples. Methodsutilizing such data are known as semi-supervised learningmethods. A systematic review of supervised and unsupervisedlearning techniques can be found in [26].3) Semi-supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learningmethods are useful when both labelled and unlabelled samplesare available for training, typically, a small amount of labelleddata and a large amount of unlabelled data. Semi-supervisedlearning techniques can be particularly useful for a varietyof healthcare applications as acquiring a sufficient amountof labelled data for model training is difficult in healthcare.Different facets of semi-supervised learning using differentlearning techniques have been proposed in the literature. Forinstance, a semi-supervised clustering method for healthcaredata is presented in [27] and a semi-supervised ML approachfor activity recognition using sensors data is presented in[28]. In [29], [30], authors applied a semi-supervised learningmethod to medical image segmentation.4) Reinforcement Learning: Methods that learn a policyfunction given a set of observations, actions, and rewards inresponse to actions performed over time fall in the class ofreinforcement learning (RL) [31]. RL has a great potentialto transform many healthcare applications and recently, it hasbeen used for context-aware symptoms checking for diseasediagnosis [32]. Furthermore, the potential of using RL forhealthcare applications can be seen through the recent exampleof the Go game, where a computer using RL with theintegration of supervised and unsupervised learning methodsdefeated a human champion player [33].B. Applications of ML in HealthcareHealthcare service providers generate a large amount ofheterogeneous data and information daily, making it difficultfor the “traditional methods” to analyze and process it. ML/DLmethods help to effectively analyze this data for actionableinsights. In addition, there are heterogeneous sources of datathat can augment healthcare data such as genomics, medicaldata, data from social media, and environmental data, etc. Adepiction of these sources of data is shown in Figure 2. Thefour major applications of healthcare that can benefit fromML/DL techniques are prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, andclinical workflow, which are described next.1) Applications of ML in Prognosis: Prognosis is the pro-cess of predicting the expected development of a disease inclinical practice. It also includes identification of symptomsand signs related to a specific disease and whether they willbecome worse, improve, or remain stable over time and identi-fication of potential associated health problems, complications,ability to perform routine activities, and the likelihood ofsurvival. As in clinical setting, multi-modal patients’ datais collected, e.g., phenotypic, genomic, proteomic, pathologytests results, and medical images, etc., which can empowerthe ML models to facilitate disease prognosis, diagnosis andtreatment [34]. For instance, ML models have been largelydeveloped for the identification and classification of differentThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

ML-based methodshave been utilized for the extraction of clinical features forfacilitating the diagnosis process [37]. For example, a semi-supervised approach for the extraction of diagnosis informa-tion from unstructured EHRs is presented in [38]. The useof ML for the diagnosis of diabetes from EHRs is presentedin [39]. In [40], features robustness using EHRs data for theyear of care for each record is examined for two tasks, i.e.,mortality prediction and length-of-stay and authors showedthat prediction performance gets degraded when ML modelsare trained on historical data and tested on unseen (future)data.b) ML in Medical Image Analysis: In medical imageanalysis, ML techniques are used for efficient and effective ex-traction of information from medical images that are acquiredusing different imaging modalities such as magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, andpositron emission tomography (PET), etc. These modalitiesprovide important functional and anatomical information aboutdifferent body organs and play a crucial role in the detec-tion/localization and diagnosis of abnormalities. A taxonomyof key medical imaging modalities is presented in Figure3. The key purpose of medical image analysis is to assistclinicians and radiologists for efficient diagnosis and prognosisof the diseases. The prominent tasks in medical image analysisinclude detection, classification, segmentation, retrieval, recon-struction, and image registration which are discussed next.Moreover, fully automated intelligent medical image diagnosissystems are expected to be part of next-generation healthcaresystems.• Enhancement: Enhancement of degraded medical imagesis an important pre-processing step that directly effectsthe diagnosis process. There are many sources of noiseand disturbances encountered in the medical image acqui-sition process which degrade the quality and significanceof the resultant images. For instance, generating MRIimages is a quite lengthy process that typically requiresseveral minutes to produce a good quality image andto acquire detailed soft-tissue contrast, patients have toremain still and straight as much as possible. Becausemovements can cause false artifacts in image acquisi-tion, the complete process has to be repeated usuallymultiple times to produce significantly useful images.Also, depending on the body area being scanned and thenumber of images to be taken, patients might be askedto hold their breath during short scans [42]. Therefore,any movement of the subject can introduce artifacts inthe acquired image. Moreover, some sort of mechanicalnoise is also sometimes introduced in the output image. Inthe literature, different DL models are used for denoisingmedical images such as convolutional denoising autoen-coders [43] and GANs. In addition, GANs have beensuccessfully used for cleaning motion artifacts introducedin multi-shot MRI images [14]. Super-resolution is yetanother powerful and impactful enhancement techniquefor medical images, e.g., MRI denoising [44].• Detection: The process of identifying specific diseasepatterns or abnormalities (e.g., tumor, cancer) in medicalimages is known as detection. In traditional clinicalpractice, such abnormalities are identified by expert ra-diologists or physicians that often require a lot of timeand effort. Whereas, DL based methods have shown theirpotential for this task and various studies have beenpresented in the literature for the detection of diseases.For instance, a locality-sensitive approach utilizing CNNfor the detection and classification of nuclei colon cancerin histopathological images is presented in [45]. A hybridmethod utilizing handcrafted features and a CNN modelfor the detection of mitosis in breast cancer images ispresented in [46].• Classification DL models in particular, convolutionalneural networks (CNNs) have proven to give high per-formance in medical image classification tasks whencompared with other state-of-the-art non-learning basedtechniques.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/RBME.2020.3013489, IEEE Reviewsin Biomedical Engineering5Fig. 3: A typology of commonly used medical imaging modalities (adapted from [41]).using CNNs have been extensively studied in the liter-ature. In [2], an approach using CNN for multi-instancerecognition of different body organs is presented and aCNN based method for classification of interstitial lungdiseases (ILDs) is presented in [3]. In another study,a CNN model is trained for the classification of lungnodules [4].Transfer learning approaches have also been used formedical image classification [47]. In transfer learning,a pre-trained DL model (typically trained on naturalimages) is fine-tuned on a comparatively small dataset ofmedical images. The results obtained by this approach, asreported in the literature, are promising; however, a fewstudies have reported contradictory results. For instance,results obtained by transfer learning in [48] and [49] arecontradictory.• Segmentation: The segmentation of tissues and organsin medical images enables quantitative analysis of ab-normalities in terms of clinical parameters, e.g., auto-matically measuring the volume and shape of cancer inbrain images. In addition, the extraction of such clinicallysignificant features is an important and foremost step incomputer-aided detection and diagnosis systems that wediscuss later in this section. The process of segmentationdeals with the partitioning of an image into multiplenon-overlapping parts using a pre-defined criterion suchas intrinsic color, texture, and contrast, etc. Addressingthe problem of segmentation utilizing various DL models(e.g, CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN) [50]) iswidely studied in the literature and the common archi-tecture used for segmentation of medical images is U-net[51]. Various DL architectures are being proposed for thesegmentation of multi-modal images such as the brain,skin cancer, CT images, etc. as well as segmentationof volumetric images [52]. An overview of various DLmodels for segmentation of medical images is presentedin [53].• Reconstruction: The process of generating interpretableimages from raw data acquired from the imaging sensor isknown as medical image reconstruction. The fundamentalproblem in medical image reconstruction is to acceleratethe inherently slow data acquisition process, which isan interesting ill-posed inverse problem in which wewant to determine the system’s input given its output.Many important medical imaging modalities require alot of time for reconstructing an image from the rawdata samples, e.g., MRI and CT. Thus in medical imagereconstruction, we aim to reduce image acquisition timeand storage space.Research on medical image reconstruction using deepmodels is drastically increasing and various DL modelssuch as CNNs [54] and autoencoders [6] have beenextensively used for the reconstruction of MRI andCT images. Recently, generative adversarial networks(GANs) have been widely used for the reconstruction ofmedical images and have produced outstanding results.For instance, a GAN based MRI reconstruction methodis presented in [55] that also cleans the motion artifacts.• Image Registration: Image registration is the process ofmapping input images with respect to a reference imageand it is the first step in image fusion. Image registrationhas many potential applications in medical image analysisas described in detail by El-Gamal et al. [56], however,their use in actual clinical applications is very limited[57]. To facilitate the surgical spinal screw implant ortumor removal, image registration is usually applied inspinal surgery or neurosurgery for the localization ofspinal bony landmark or a tumor, respectively. Varioussimilarity metrics and reference points are calculated toalign the sensed image with the reference image. In [58],a framework for deformable image registration namedas Quicksilver is proposed that uses the large deforma-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Similarly, an unsupervisedlearning based methods for deformable image registrationis presented in . In [59], a CNN based regression approachfor 2D/3D image registration is presented that addressestwo fundamental limitations of existing intensity-basedimage registration methods, i.e., small capture range andslow computation.• Retrieval: The recent era has witnessed the revolutionof digital interventions from the large-scale image andvideo collections to big data. This trend is true formedical imaging as well, every hospital and clinic havingradiology services are producing thousands of medicalimages daily in diverse modalities, resulting in the growthof large-scale multi-modal medical image repositories.Thus making it difficult to manage and query suchhuge databases. In particular, it is more challenging formulti-modal medical data. To facilitate the productionand management of multi-modal medical data, traditionalmethods are not sufficient and various ML/DL techniquesare proposed in the literature [60], [61].In routine practice, clinicians usually compare the currentcases with the previous ones, mainly to effectively planthe diagnosis and treatment of the patient being examined.In this regard, identifying modality (i.e., modality classifi-cation discussed above) is of great significance as it servesas an initial tool to facilitate the process of comparisonand an efficient modality classification system will reducethe search space by only looking for relevant images inthe collections of the desired modality.3) Applications of ML in Treatment:a) Image Interpretation: As discussed above, medicalimages are widely used in the routine clinical practice andthe analysis and interpretation of these images are performedby expert physicians and radiologists. To narrate the findingsregarding images being studied, they write textual radiologyreports about each body organ that was examined in theconducted study. However, writing such reports is very chal-lenging in some scenarios, e.g., less experienced radiologistsand healthcare service providers in rural areas where thequality of healthcare services is not up to the mark. On theother side, for experienced radiologists and pathologists, theprocess of preparing high-quality reports can be tedious andtime-consuming which can be exacerbated by a large numberof patients visiting daily. Therefore, various researchers haveattempted to address this problem using natural languageprocessing (NLP) and ML techniques. In [62], a naturallanguage processing based method is proposed for annotatingclinical radiology reports. A multi-task ML based frameworkis proposed for automatic tagging and description of medicalimages [63]. In a similar study [64], an end-to-end architecturedeveloped with the integration of CNN and RNN is presentedfor thorax disease classification and reporting in chest X-rays. In [65], a novel multi-modal model utilizing CNN andlong short term memory (LSTM) network is developed forautomatic report generation.b) ML in Real-time Health Monitoring: Real-time mon-itoring of critical patients is crucial and is a key componentof the treatment process. Continuous health monitoring usingwearable devices, IoT sensors, and smartphones is gaininginterest among people. In a typical setting of continuous healthmonitoring, health data is collected using a wearable deviceand smartphone and then transmitted to the cloud for analysisusing an ML/DL technique. Then the outcomes are transmittedback to the device for appropriate action(s). For instance, aframework having a similar system architecture is presentedin [66]. The system is developed by integrating mobile andcloud for monitoring of heart rate using PPG signals. Simi-larly, a review of different ML techniques for human activityrecognition with application to remote monitoring of patientsusing wearable devices is presented in [67]. The sharing ofhealth data with clouds for further analysis raises many privacyand security challenges that we discuss in the next section.4) Applications of ML in Clinical Workflows:a) Disease Prediction and Diagnosis: The early predic-tion and diagnosis of diseases from medical data are oneof the exciting applications of ML. Various studies havehighlighted the potential of using predictive healthcare forthe timely treatment of diseases. For instance, the case ofcardiovascular risk prediction using different ML algorithmswith clinical data is studied in [68] and the study concludedthat ML techniques improved the prediction efficacy. A surveyof various ML techniques for the detection and diagnosis ofdifferent diseases (such as diabetes, dengue, hepatitis, heart,and liver) is presented in [69]. The potential of using ML-based methods for prediction and prognosis of cancer ishighlighted in [70].b) ML in Computer-Aided Detection or Diagnosis: Thecomputer-aided detection (CADe) or computer-aided diagnosis(CADx) systems are being developed mainly for the auto-matic interpretation of medical images that would assist theradiologist in their clinical practice. The system works byutilizing different functionalities including ML/DL, traditionalcomputer vision and image processing techniques and reliesheavily on the performance of these techniques. IBM’s Wat-son is a classical example of CADx system developed byintegrating various techniques including ML. However, anytask in medical image and signal analysis automated by theapplication of ML/DL models can be deemed as a CADe orCADx systems, e.g., automation detection of fatty liver inultrasound kurtosis imaging [71].c) Clinical Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcementlearning, the key objective is to learn a policy function formaking precise decisions in an uncertain environment tomaximise accumulated reward. In clinical medicine, RL can beused for providing optimal diagnosis and treatment for patientswith distinct characteristics [72]. The performance evaluationof different RL techniques (i.e., Q-value iteration, tabular Q-learning, fitted Q-iteration (FQI), and deep Q-learning) for thetreatment of sepsis in ICU using real-world medical datasetis presented in [73]. Sepsis is a severe infection involvingorgan dysfunction and is a leading cause of mortality dueto expensive and suboptimal treatment. The dataset containstrajectories of a patient’s physiological state and the providedtreatments by clinicians at each time, along with the outcome(i.e., survival or mortality).

In a recent study, attention models areused for the management of ICUs forecasting tasks (such asdiagnosis, estimation, and prediction, etc.) by integrating clin-ical notes with multivariate and time-series measurements data[76]. In a similar study, the problem of unexpected respiratorydecompensation using ML techniques is investigated in [77].e) Clinical Natural Language Processing: Clinical notesare a widely used tool by the clinicians to communicate patientstate. The use of clinical text is crucial as it often containsthe most important information. The progress in clinical NLPtechniques is envisioned to be incorporated in future clinicalsoftware for extracting relevant information from unstructuredclinical notes for improving clinical practice and research[78]. Clinical NLP offers unique challenges such as the useof acronyms, language disparity, partial structure, and qualityvariance, etc. The challenges and opportunities of clinical NLPfor languages other than English along with a review of clinicalNLP techniques is presented in [79]. In [80], authors presenteda toolkit named CLAMP that provides different state of theart NLP techniques for clinical text analysis.f) Clinical Speech and Audio Processing: In the clinicalenvironment, clinicians have to do a lot of documentation, i.e.,preparing clinical notes, discharge summaries, and radiologyreports, etc. According to Dr. Simon Wallace, clinicians spend50% of their time on clinical documentation and are highlydemotivated due to clinical workload, administrative tasks, andlack of leisure time [81]. Typically, they spend more time inpreparing clinical documentation as compared to interactingdirectly with patients. To overcome such challenges, clinicalspeech and audio processing offer new opportunities suchas speech interfaces for interaction less services, automatictranscription of patient conversations, and synthesis of clin-ical notes, etc. There are many benefits for using speechand audio processing tools in the clinical environment foreach stakeholder, i.e., patients (speech is a new modalityfor determining patient state), clinicians (efficiency and time-saving), and healthcare industry (enhance productivity andcost reduction). In the literature, speech processing has beenused for the identification of disorders related to speech,e.g., vocal hyperfunction [82] and as well as disorders thatmanifest through speech, e.g., dementia [83]. Alzheimer’sdisease identification using linguistic features is presented in[84]. In clinical speech processing, disfluency and utterancesegmentation are two well-known challenges of clinical speechprocessing.III. SECURE, PRIVATE, AND ROBUST ML FORHEALTHCARE: CHALLENGESIn this section, we analyze the security and robustness ofML/DL models in healthcare settings and present variousassociated challenges.A. Sources of Vulnerabilities in ML PipelineML application in healthcare settings suffers from variousprivacy and security challenges that we will thoroughly discussin this section. In addition, the three major phases of MLmodel development along with different potential sources ofvulnerabilities causing such challenges in each step of the MLpipeline are depicted in Figure 4.1) Vulnerabilities in Data Collection: Training of ML/DLmodels for clinical decision support requires the collectionof a large amount of data (in formats such as EHRs, medicalimages, radiology reports, etc.), which is in general often time-consuming and requires significant human efforts. Althoughin practice, medical data is carefully collected to ensure theeffectiveness of the diagnosis, however, there can be manysources of vulnerabilities that can affect the proper (expected)This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/RBME.2020.3013489, IEEE Reviewsin Biomedical Engineering8functionality of the underlying ML/DL systems, a few of themare described next.Instrumental and Environmental Noise: The collected dataoften contains many artifacts that arise due to instrumental andenvironmental disturbances. Let’s consider the example of oneof the widely used imagining modalities used to acquire high-resolution medical images, i.e., multishot MRI. This modalityis highly sensitive to motion, and even slight movement of thesubject’s head or respiration can cause undesirable artifactsin the resultant image [14], thereby increasing the risk ofmisdiagnosis [85].Unqualified Personnel: Healthcare ecosystems are ex-tremely interdisciplinary and comprise of technical and non-technical personnel and often lack qualified workers that candevelop and maintain ML/DL systems. As for the efficientapplication of data-driven healthcare, workers with strongstatistical and computational backgrounds are required, e.g.,engineers and data scientists. On the contrary, the clinicalusability of ML/DL based systems is extremely important.Considering this aspect, hospitals tend to rely solely onphysician-researchers who lack computational expertise todevelop such systems [86].2) Vulnerabilities Due to Data Annotation: Most applica-tions of ML/DL in healthcare systems are supervised ML taskswhich require an abundance of labelled training data. Theprocess of assigning labels to each data sample (e.g., medicalimage) is known as data annotation. Ideally, this task shallmostly be performed by experienced clinicians (physiciansor radiologists) to prepare domain-enriched datasets whichare crucial to the development of useful ML/DL models inhealthcare systems. The literature has revealed that trainingML/DL models without a sound grip of the domain couldbe disastrous [87]. However, clinicians like expert radiologistsare rare professionals and hard to engage in secondary taskslike data annotation. As a result, trainee staff (with littledomain expertise) or ML/DL automated algorithms are usuallyemployed during data labelling, which often leads to manyproblems such as coarse-grained labels, class imbalance, labelleakage, and misspecification. Some specific data annotation-based vulnerabilities are discussed as below:Ambiguous Ground Truth: In medical datasets, the groundtruth is often ambiguous, e.g., medical image classificationtask [22] and even expert clinicians disagree on well-defineddiagnostic tasks [88]. This problem becomes more adversewith the presence of malicious users who want to perturbdata, making the diagnosis difficult and causing difficultiesin detecting its influence even with a human expert review.Improper Annotation: The annotation of data samples pro-cess for life-critical healthcare applications should be informedby proper guidelines and various privacy and legal considera-tions [89]. Most widely used healthcare datasets are annotatedfor coarse-grained labels whereas real-life utility of ML/DLis to highlight rare, fine-grained and hidden strata withinthe clinical environment. This inability to perform labellingappropriately can lead to various efficiency challenges that arediscussed next.Efficiency Challenges: The collections of healthcare dataon which ML/DL models are built suffer from various issuesthat arise several efficiency challenges. A few major problemsimpacting the quality of data are described next.(a) Limited and Imbalanced Datasets: The size of datasetsused for training ML/DL models is not up to the requiredscale. In particular, one major limitation of the efficientapplication of DL approaches in healthcare is the unavail-ability of large-scale datasets, as health data is often smallin size. Notably, most life-threating health conditions arenaturally rare and diagnosed once in many (thousandsto millions) patients. Therefore, most ML/DL algorithmscan not be efficiently trained and optimized for such life-threatening healthcare task.(b) Data Augmentation: To circumvent the problem of avail-ability of large scale medical datasets, one commonlyfollowed method is data augmentation in which vari-ous techniques (such as cropping, filliping, rotation, andtranslation, etc.) are used for diversifying the trainingdata and increasing its size. In addition, different trans-formation techniques are used for augmenting trainingdatasets, e.g., use of Gaussian for data augmentation [90],[91]. However, the use of data augmentation might reducethe robustness of the developed ML/DL based system,for example, it is highly likely that the distribution oftransformed data diverges from the underlying actual dis-tribution of the training data which is unknown generallyand there are no statistical and probabilistical guaranteesfor having same distribution of the training data. Theliterature suggest that Guassain data augmentation doesnot improves the adversarial robustness of the modelsagainst iterative attacks [92].(c) Class Imbalance and Bias: Class imbalance is yet anotherproblem that arises in the supervised ML/DL which refersto the fact that the distribution of samples among classesis not uniform. If a class imbalanced dataset is used fortraining of the model then it will be reflected in themodel’s outcomes in terms of bias to certain categories.Biases in models’ predictions in healthcare settings willhave profound consequences and should, therefore, bemitigated. Various approaches have been proposed inthe literature to address class imbalance problems. Theseapproaches are discussed in the next section.(d) Sparsity: Data sparsity, i.e., missing values are commonin real-world data that arise due to various reasons (e.g.,unmeasured and unreported samples, etc.). Missing val-ues and observations significantly affect the performanceof ML/DL techniques.3) Vulnerabilities in Model Training: The vulnerabilitiesregarding model training include improper or incomplete train-ing, privacy breaches, model poisoning and stealing. Improperor incomplete training refers to the situations when the ML/DLmodel is trained with improper parameters, e.g., learning rate,epochs, batch size. Moreover, ML/DL models have been foundstrictly vulnerable to various security and privacy threats suchas adversarial attacks [20], model [93] and data poisoningattacks [94], etc. The vulnerabilities of ML/DL systems hindertheir efficient deployment for security-critical applications(such as digital forensic, bio-metrics, etc.) and as well as life-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Therefore, ensuring the security and integrity of theML/DL systems is of paramount importance for such criticalapplications. Various security threats associated with ML/DLsystems are thoroughly described in the next section.4) Vulnerabilities in Deployment Phase: The deploymentof ML/DL techniques in a clinical environment essentiallyinvolves human-centric decisions. Therefore, ensuring the ro-bustness of the system while considering fairness and account-ability is necessary for the deployment phase. The followingare the major vulnerabilities that can be encountered in the de-ployment phase of ML/DL systems. Whereas, security issues(e.g., adversarial attacks) are discussed in the next section.Distribution Shifts: Distributions shifts are very much ex-pected in realistic healthcare settings, for example, let’s con-sider different imaging centers and DL models trained onimages of one domain (imaging center) are subsequentlydeployed on different domain images. In such settings, the per-formance of the underlying DL model degrades significantly.Moreover, in predictive healthcare, ML models are developedusing historical patient data and are usually tested on the newpatients which raise questions about the efficacy of the MLpredictions. Moreover, such differences can be exploited forgenerating adversarial examples [95].Incomplete Data: In realistic settings, data collected forproviding patient care may contain missing observations orvariables, e.g., EHRs. The simplest way to avoid missingvalues is to ignore them completely while doing analysisbut it cannot be done without knowing their relationshipswith already observed or unobserved data. Using the missingobservations for training ML/DL models, on the other hand,leads to two well-known problems, i.e., false positives (ahealthy person is diagnosed with a disease) and false negatives(a patient is identified as healthy). Both problems can havesevere outcomes in actual healthcare settings, therefore, thehealthcare data should be complete and compact in all aspectsto ensure accurate predictions of outcomes.5) Vulnerabilities in Testing Phase: Vulnerabilities in thetesting phase are concerned with the interpretation of theresults from the underlying ML/DL systems that includemisinterpretation, false positive, and false-negative outcomes.False-positive and false-negative outcomes are due to incom-plete/inefficient training of the model or due to incompletedata fed for the inference that we have discussed in the earliersection. Finally, the true essence of ML empowered healthcareis not just about turning a crank but it demands the cautiousapplication of analytical methods [96].B. The Security of ML: An OverviewIn this section, we provide an overview of ML securityparticularly from the perspective of healthcare and highlightvarious associated security challenges with the use of ML.1) Security Threats: The security threats on ML systemscan be broadly categorized into three dimensions, i.e., influ-ence attacks, security violations, and attack specificity [97]. Ataxonomy of these security threats on ML systems is depictedin Figure 5.Fig. 5: A taxonomy of different security threats on ML/DLmodels.(a) Influence: Influence attacks can be of two types: (1)causative: the one that attempts to get control overtraining data; (2) exploratory: the one that exploits themiss-classification of the ML model without interveningthe model training.(b) Security Violation: It is concerned with the availabilityand integrity of the services and can be categorized intothree types: (1) integrity attack: It attempts to increasethe false-negative rate of the deployed model (classifier)when the model is given harmful inputs; (2) availabilityattack: Unlike integrity attack, it tries to achieve anincrease in the false-positive rate of the classifier in re-sponse to benign inputs; (3) privacy violation attack: It isconcerned with the unveiling of sensitive and confidentialinformation of the training data, trained model or both.(c) Attack Specificity: The specificity of an attack can bedefined in two ways: (1) targeted attack: whether theattack is intended for a specific input sample or a groupof samples; (2) indiscriminate attack: it causes the MLmodel to fail indiscriminately.The first axis in the taxonomy of the attacks on ML/DLsystems (as shown in Figure 5) defines the capabilities of theadversaries, e.g., whether they are able to modify trainingprocess by injecting poisoned data or not (i.e., attemptingaccess to training data). If the attacker does not have access tothe training data, the attacker can realize an exploratory attack,e.g., consider a disease classification problem, the adversarycan exploit query-response pairs to get intended behavior(i.e., misclassification in this case). The second dimensionof attacks is concerned with the type of security violationsthat an adversary can perform, e.g., trying to learn about theprivacy of users in training data or attempting to increase thefalse-negative or false-positive rate of the classifier. Each typeof security violation is severely problematic for healthcareapplications, i.e., preserving the privacy of users is a matterof high concern, and models with minimum uncertainty arehighly desirable. The third dimension describes the specificobjectives of the adversary. The attacker might be interestedin attempting a targeted attack, e.g., forcing the classifier toclassify a given input sample to a target class (e.g., bypassingThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Adversarialattacks have appeared as one of the biggest security threats toML/DL systems [20], [98], [99], [100], [101]. In adversarialattacks, the key goal of an adversary is to generate adversarialexamples by adding small carefully crafted (unnoticeable)perturbation into the actual (non-modified) input samples toevade the integrity of the ML/DL system. In general, thereare two types of adversarial attacks that are described next.(a) Poisoning Attacks: Adversarial attacks affecting themodel training, i.e., manipulating the training data tomislead the learning of ML/DL model are known aspoisoning attacks [93].(b) Evasion Attacks: Adversarial attacks on the inferencephase of the training process are known as evasionattacks [102]. In such attacks, an attacker manipulatesthe test data to compromise the integrity of the ML/DLmodel to harmful inputs.In healthcare applications, poisoning attacks are highlyrelevant because direct manipulation of the training data maybe difficult or even impossible in some cases. Alternatively,the addition of new samples might be relatively easy, how-ever, any such consequences hinder the applicability of theML/DL systems. Therefore, the detection of poisoning attacksis critical for the robust application of ML/DL in healthcareapplications. For instance, systematic poisoning attacks againstsix conventional ML models that were developed for hypothy-roid diagnosis are presented in [103], where the objective ofthe attacker was to prevent hypothyroid diagnosis.Similarly, a few researchers have highlighted the threatof these attacks to ML/DL models in healthcare settingsand we provide insights from such articles in this section.Unlike adversarial examples created for evading ML/DL mod-els in other settings, the concept of adversarial patients forhealthcare applications is introduced in [17]. The authorsargue that rather than intentional adversarial examples, thecaution should be for unintentional adversarial patients thatcan lead to severe ethical issues. They identified a subgroup ofadversarial patients and empirically validated that patients withidentical predictive features can have significantly differentindividual treatment effects. In recent studies, white box andblack box adversarial attacks have been demonstrated againstthree clinical applications; namely, fundoscopy, dermoscopy,and chest X-ray analysis [22], [104]. Furthermore, in [104],authors highlighted various potential incentives for adversariesvia adversarial attacks in clinical trials that will rise withthe increasing use of ML in the future, particularly, with theemergence of computer-aided diagnosis and decision supportsystems.Adversarial ML is a major dilemma for the security andprivacy of ML/DL models deployed in healthcare biometricsapplications and can lead to sever unintended circumstances.Biometrics can provide many advantages, e.g., fraud detec-tion, protection of confidential medical records, and securingmedical facilities and equipment, etc. In this regard, differentbiometrics technologies such as palm vein readers, fingerprint,ECG, and iris scanners [105], and face recognition have greatpotential to be deployed in healthcare systems. It is verycommon to use ML/DL techniques for building healthcarebiometric systems, which are themselves vulnerable to securityand privacy attacks [106], [107], [108]. For example, anadversary can easily evade a face recognition system that isdeployed in a restricted area to restrain unintended access forsecurity purposes.C. ML for Healthcare: ChallengesIn this section, we discuss various challenges which hindersthe applicability of ML/DL systems in practical healthcareapplications.1) Safety Challenges: Excellent performance in a con-trolled lab environment (which is a common ML communitypractice) is not evidence of safety. Safety of ML/DL is thedetermination of how safe the ML/DL system is for patients.There should be a constant thought of safety throughout theML/DL lifecycle. Majority of routine clinicians tasks aremundane, and patients they encounter have common healthconditions. It is their role of diagnosing rare, subtle, and hid-den health conditions which occur once in millions. EnablingML/DL to performing well on hidden strata, outliers, edge, andsubtle cases is key to ensure the safety of current AI systems.2) Privacy Challenges: Privacy is one of the major chal-lenges in data-driven healthcare which is concerned with theuse of users’ data by the ML/DL systems for making pre-dictions. The users (i.e., patients) expect that their healthcareservice providers are following necessary safety measures tosafeguard their inherent right to the privacy of their confiden-tial information, e.g., age, sex, date of birth, and health data.Potential privacy threats can be of two types, i.e., unveilingconfidential information and malicious use of data (potentiallyby unauthorized agents).Privacy depends upon the characteristics and nature of thedata being collected, the environment it has been created in,and patients’ demographics. Therefore, mitigation of privacybreaches using the appropriate technique(s) is critical as suchbreaches can directly harm the patients. The confidential datashould be anonymized to prevent privacy breaches such as (re-)identification of the individuals [109]. Moreover, necessaryattention should be paid to understand privacy concerns ateach stage of data processing and the transfer of data amongdifferent departments within a hospital should be communi-cated in a secure environment.Privacy challenges also arise with adoption of ML/DL tech-niques for building biometric healthcare systems either offline(e.g., face or fingerprint recognition based system to protectmedical facilities and equipment [110]) or online systems,e.g., real-time medical systems [111] and use of biometricsfor authentication of medical IoT devices [112], etc. Thesecurity and privacy of such systems are of utmost importance;therefore, worst-case robustness test should be performed forbiometrically secure healthcare systems. Worst-case testingis a powerful tool that can provide enough evidence aboutThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Explicit measures should be taken to understand thetargeted user population and their sociological aspects beforecollecting data for building ML models. Moreover, understand-ing how data collection can harm a patient’s well-being anddignity is an important consideration in this regard. If ethicalconcerns are not taken into account then the application of MLin realistic settings will have adverse results. Furthermore, toensure fair and ethical operation of automated systems, it isimperative to have a clear understanding of the AI system inuncertain and complex scenarios [113].4) Causality is Challenging: Understanding causality isimportant in healthcare because most of the crucial healthcareproblems require causal reasoning, i.e., “what if?” [114]. Forexample, asking a question about what will happen if a doctorprescribed treatment A instead of treatment B. Such questionscannot be exploited through classical learning algorithms andto answer them we need to analyze the data from the lens ofcausality [115]. In healthcare, learning is often solely basedon observational data and asking causal questions by learningfrom observational data is quite challenging which requiresbuilding causal models.DL models are black-box which lacks fundamental under-lying theory and these models essentially work by exploitingpatterns and correlations without considering any causal link[116]. In general, this cannot be deemed as a limitation sinceprediction does not require any causal relation. In predictivehealthcare, the absence of causal relation can raise questionsabout the conclusions that can be drawn from outcomes of DLmodels. Furthermore, fairness in decision making can betterbe enforced through the lens of causal reasoning [117], [118].The estimation of the causal effect of some variable(s) ona target output (e.g., target class in multi-class classificationproblem) is important to ensure fair predictions.5) Regulatory and Policy Challenges: The full potentialof ML/DL systems (which essentially constitutes software asa medical device) in actual healthcare settings can only berealized by addressing regulatory and policy challenges. Theliterature suggests that the regulatory guidelines are neededfor both medical ML/DL systems and their integration inactual clinical settings [131]. Therefore, the integration of AI-empowered ML/DL systems in the actual clinical environmentshould be in compliance with the policies and regulationsdefined by the government and regulatory agencies. However,existing regulations are not suitable for certifying systemswhich are ever-evolving such as ML/DL empowered systemsbecause yet another key challenge with the use of ML/DLalgorithms in clinical practice is to determine how thesemodels should be implemented and regulated since thesemodels will incorporate learning from the new patient data[132]. In addition, the objective clinical evaluation of ML/DLsystems for particular clinical settings is crucial to ensuresafe, effective, and robust operation that does not harm thepatients in either way. Data scientist and AI engineers shouldbe employed in hospitals for assessing AI systems regularlyto ensure it is still safe, relevant, and working fine.6) Availability of Good Quality Data: The availability ofrepresentative, diverse and high-quality data is one of themajor challenges in healthcare. For instance, the amountof data available to the research community is very smallin size and limited in scope as compared to the heteroge-neous collections of large-scale multi-modal patient data beinggenerated on daily basis by different small and large sizehealthcare institutions. However, the development of goodquality data that resembles real clinical settings is on theother very challenging and requires resources for managementand maintenance. The availability of high-quality data caneffectively serve the intended purpose of disease predictionand decision making for planning treatment.The data collected in practice suffer from different issuessuch as subjectivity, redundancy, and bias. As the ML/DLmodels perform inferences by solely learning the latent factorsof the data on which they are trained, therefore, the effect ofdata generated by the undesirable past practices of hospitalswill be reflected in the outcomes of the algorithm. For exam-ple, most people with no health insurance are denied health-care services and if AI learns from that data, it will do thesame. It has been shown that a model could depict racial biasby producing varying outcomes for different subpopulations[133] and the training data can also introduce its own modelingchallenges [134], [135].7) Lack of Data Standardization and Exchange: MedicalML/DL system shall facilitate a deep understanding of theunderlying healthcare task, which (in most cases) can only beachieved by utilising other forms of patients data. For example,radiology is not all about clinical imaging. Other patient EMRdata is crucial for radiologists to derive the precise conclusionfor an imaging study. This calls for the integration and dataexchange between all healthcare systems. Despite extensiveresearch on data exchange standards for healthcare, there isa huge ignorance in following those standards in healthcareIT systems which broadly affects the quality and efficacy ofhealthcare data, accumulated through these systems. Thereare numerous guidelines to perform specific medical inter-ventions like imaging studies (i.e., with define exposure andpositioning) to ensure the significance of the data clinically.However, current healthcare IT systems largely ignore stan-dards and clinicians barely follow well-established guidelines.As a result, data integration and exchange efforts acrossdifferent specialities and organisations fail. Data integrationto match diverse patients’ medical records is crucial to deliverhigh-value patient care. The lack of appetite to implementdata exchange standards in wider healthcare industry hindersthe efficacy of ML/DL systems as multi-modal data is vitalto ensure the deep understanding of algorithms, and willundoubtedly enhance the performance of physicians towardsclinical decisions using data driven insights.8) Distribution Shifts: The problem of data distributionshifts is yet another major challenge and perhaps one of themost challenging problems to solve [136]. In clinical practice,training and testing data distributions can diverge due to manyreasons, e.g., medical data is generated by different institutionsusing different devices for patients having complicated cases.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Distribution shifts are frequent inthe medical domain, in particular, medical imagining wheredifferent protocols and parameter choices can result in imagesof significantly different distributions. ML models are typicallytrained under the principle of empirical risk minimization(ERM) which provides good learning bounds and guaranteesif its assumptions are satisfied. For instance, one of theforemost and strong assumptions is that both the trainingand test datasets are derived from a similar domain (i.e.,data distributions). However, this assumption is not valid inpractice, and models trained under such an assumption fail togeneralize to other domains In contrast, the life-critical natureof clinical applications demands a smooth and safe operationof ML/DL techniques.9) Updating Hospital Infrastructure is Hard: Healthcare ITsystems are mostly proprietary and operate in silos, which re-sults in the revision, fixing, and update of software being costlyand time-consuming. It has been reported in the literature thatin 2013, the majority of hospitals were using the ninth versionof the international classification of disease (ICD) system—even though a revised version (i.e., ICD-10) was releasedas early as 1990 [22]. The difficulties in updating hospitalsoftware infrastructure can raise many vulnerabilities with theuse of modern tools like ML/DL systems.IV. SECURE, PRIVATE, AND ROBUST ML FORHEALTHCARE: SOLUTIONSIn this section, we present an overview of various proposedmethods to ensure secure, private, and robust ML for health-care applications. A summary of articles focused on the topicof “secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare” is pre-sented in Table II and various approaches for secure, private,and robust ML are described next. In addition, a taxonomyof commonly used approaches for secure, private, and robustML is presented in Figure 6 and described individually next.A. Privacy-Preserving MLPreserving the privacy of the user in healthcare isparamount, as it is a user-centric application and involvesthe collection of personal data and any breach of privacy canlead to unavoidable consequences. Preserving privacy meansthat ML model training and inference should not reveal anyadditional information about the subjects from whom data wascollected. In general, ML/DL requires training data stored ona central repository (e.g., cloud) that may include the users’private data which raises various threats and to address suchconcerns data anonymization techniques are used. However, ithas been reported in the literature that meaningful informationcan be inferred about individuals’ private data even when thedata is anonymized [137].Various efforts in the literature have addressed the privacyissues with the use of ML. Three different protocols for thetwo-server model are presented in [138], where the privatedata is distributed among two non-colluding servers by thedata owners and then those servers train the ML modelson the joint data by following secure two-party computation(2PC). Furthermore, different techniques have been proposedto perform secure arithmetic operations in the secure multi-party computational environment and alternatives to nonlinearactivation functions used in ML models such as softmax andsigmoid are also proposed. Similarly, various techniques forprivacy-preserving ML such as cryptographic and differentialprivacy approaches are discussed in [109]. Here we brieflydiscuss the widely used methods for preserving privacy.1) Cryptographic Approaches: Cryptographic approachesare used in the scenarios where the ML model requires en-crypted data (for training and testing purposes) from multipleThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The widely used methods include homomorphic en-cryption, secret sharing, garbled circuits, and secure processorswhich are briefly described next.(a) Homomorphic Encryption: It enables computations onencrypted data with operations such as addition andmultiplication which can be used as a basis for computingcomplex functions. Typically, the data is encrypted usingciphertext and public keys of the original data owners.(b) Garbled Circuits: Garbled circuits are used in caseswhere two parties (let’s assume Alice and Bob) wantto get results computed using their private data. Alicewill send the function in the form of the garbled circuitalong with her input. After obtaining the garbled versionof his input from Alice in oblivious fashion, Bob willuse his garbled input with the garbled circuit to get theresult of the required function and can share it with Alice,if required. The use of homomorphic encryption andgarbled circuits to build cryptographic blocks for develop-ing three classification techniques; namely, Naı¨ve Bayes,decision trees, and hyperplane decision is presented in[144], where the goal is to protect ML models and newsamples submitted for inference.(c) Secret Sharing: The strategy of distributing secret amongmultiple parties while holding a “share” of the secretis known as secret sharing. The secret can only bereconstructed when all individual shares are combined;otherwise, they are unuseful. In some settings, the secretis reconstructed using t shares (where t is a thresholdvalue) that will not require all shares to be combined. Asecret sharing paradigm for computing privacy-preservingparallelized principal component analysis (PCA) is pre-sented in [125]. In a similar study [142], a protocol isdeveloped using the “secret sharing” strategy for ag-gregating model updates received from multiple inputparties, the updates are used for training of the ML model.A privacy-preserving emotion recognition framework ispresented in [143]. Authors used a multi-secret sharingscheme for transmitting audio-visual data collected fromusers using edge devices to the cloud where a CNN andsparse autoencoder were applied for feature extractionand support vector machine (SVM) was used for emotionrecognition.(d) Secure Processors: Secure processors were originallydeveloped by rogue software to ensure the confidentialityand integrity of sensitive code from unauthorized accessat higher privilege levels. However, these processors arebeing utilized in privacy-preserving computation, e.g.,Intel SGXprocessor. For instance, Ohrimenko et al. devel-oped an SGX-processor-based data oblivious system fork-mean clustering, decision trees, SVM, and matrix fac-torization [146]. The key idea was to enable collaborationbetween multiple data owners running the ML task on anThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/RBME.2020.3013489, IEEE Reviewsin Biomedical Engineering14TABLE III: The comparisons of different techniques that can be used for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML).Technique Methodology Papers Advantage (s) Limitation (s)HomomorphicEncryptionComputations are performed on en-crypted data that is encrypted usingdifferent cryptographic approaches.[139], [140], [141] Can be used for outsourcing computa-tions on private data.Slow and computationally intensive andcan only receive input from one entity.Multi-PartyComputationComputations are performed on se-cret inputs from multiple parties.[125], [142], [143] Fast and less overhead and can receiveinput from multiple parties and ensuresthe correctness of input and privacy.It becomes slow with a large number ofparticipating parties.Garbled Cir-cuitsGarbled circuits are used in caseswhere two parties want to get re-sults computed using their privatedata.[144], [145], [138] Secure computation on the private dataof multiple parties.Low latency, as it requires the compu-tation of expensive operations.SecureProcessorsCollaboration between multipledata owners is performed throughan SGX-enabled data center.[146], [147], [148] Adversaries can get control over dataand software except the SGX-processorbeing used for computations.Adversaries can get control over dataand software.DifferentialPrivacyRandom statistical noise is addedto each attribute, to protect privacy.[127], [149], [150] Highly practical, as no computationaloverhead is involved because no en-cryption is performed.Addition of noise effects precision andhas some limitations from security per-spectives.FederatedLearningA shared model is collaborativelytrained from distributed data with-out sharing the data itself.[151], [152], [130] Less communication overhead, as localdata is not required to be transmittedand enables collaborative learning.Parameters optimization in federatedlearning is challenging.SGX-enabled data center. All types of communicationsbetween the data owners and the enclave were performedby establishing independently a secure channel (i.e., anindividual channel for each data owner).2) Differential Privacy: Differential privacy refers to themechanism of adding perturbation into the datasets to pro-tect private data. The idea of adding adequate noise in thedatabase for preserving privacy was first introduced by C.Dwork in 2006 [153]. Differential privacy constitutes a strongstandard for guaranteeing privacy for algorithms performinganalysis on aggregate databases and it is defined in termsof the application-specific concept of neighbor datasets [154].Differential privacy is particularly useful for applications likehealthcare due to its several properties such as group privacy,composability, and robustness to auxiliary information. Groupprivacy implies elegant degradation of privacy guaranteeswhen datasets contain correlated samples. Whereas, compos-ability enables modularity of the algorithmic design, i.e., whenindividual components are differentially private. Robustnessto auxiliary information means that the privacy of the systemwill not be affected by the use of any side’s information thatis known to the adversary. To avoid privacy breaches, theresearchers can also explore encrypted and noisy datasets forbuilding ML empowered healthcare applications [155].Various approaches for differential privacy have been pro-posed in the literature, e.g., private aggregation of teacherensembles (PATE) for private ML [156], differentially pri-vate stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm [154],moments accountant [157], hyperparameter selection [158],Laplace [159] and exponential noise differential privacy mech-anisms [160], [161]. For instance, privacy-preserving dis-tributed DL for clinical data using differential privacy thatincorporates the idea of cyclical weight transfer is presentedin [127].3) Federated Learning: The idea of federated learning (FL)has been recently proposed by Google Inc. [162]. In FL, ashared ML model is built using distributed data from multipledevices where each device trains the model using its local dataand then shares the model parameters with the central modelwithout sharing its actual data. An FL-based decentralizedscheme using iterative cluster primal-dual splitting (cPDS)algorithm to predict hospitalization requiring patients usinglarge-scale EHR of heart-related diseases is presented in [151].In [152], simple vanilla, U-shaped, and vertically partitioneddata-based configurations for split learning DL models are pre-sented. The proposed framework is named SplitNN that doesnot require sharing of patients’ critical data with the server.A framework of federated autonomous deep learning (FADL)using distributed EHR is presented in [130]. A comparisonof different privacy preserving techniques discussed above ispresented in Table III.B. Countermeasures Against Adversarial AttacksIn the recent literature, countermeasures against adversarialattacks are categorized into three classes: (1) modifying model;(2) modifying data; and (3) adding an auxiliary model(s) [163].A taxonomy of such methods is presented in Figure 7 and arediscussed next.1) Modifying Model: The modifying model includes meth-ods that modify the parameters or features of the trained MLmodel, widely used methods include the following:• Defensive Distillation: The distillation of neural networkswas first introduced by Hinton et al. as a method fortransferring the knowledge from a larger model to asmaller one [164]. The notion of network distillationwas then adopted by Papernot et al. to defend againstadversarial attacks, also known as defensive distillation[165]. The authors used the predicted labels of the firstmodel as the labels of the input sample to the originalDL model. This strategy increases the robustness of theDL model to considerably small perturbations. However,in a later study, Carlini and Wagner demonstrated thattheir proposed adversarial attack (named as C&W attack)evaded the defensive distillation method [166].• Network Verification: The techniques verifying certainproperties of DL models in response to input samples areknown as network verification methods. The key goal isto restrain adversarial examples while checking whetherthe input satisfied or violated certain properties. In [167],such a method is proposed that uses ReLU activation andThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Defenses are categorized into three categories: (1) ModifyingData; (2) Modifying Model; and (3) Adding Auxiliary Model(s).satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) to make deep modelsresilient against adversarial attacks.• Gradient Regularization: The idea of using input gra-dient regularization for defending adversarial exampleswas proposed by Ross et al. [168]. They trained thedifferentiable models by regularizing the variation in theresults with respect to the change in the input due towhich small adversarial perturbations were not able toaffect the output of DL models. However, this methodincreases the complexity of the training process by afactor of two.• Classifier Robustifying: In this method, classificationmodels are developed that are robust to adversarial attacksrather than building a detection strategy for such attacks.In [169], authors exploited the uncertainty around theadversarial examples and proposed a hybrid model byutilizing Gaussian processes (GPs) with RBF kernels ontop of DNNs to make them robust against adversarialattacks. In a similar study, a robust model is proposedfor MNIST classification that uses analysis by synthesisthrough learned class-conditional data distribution.• Interpretable ML: It includes those methods that aimat explaining and interpreting the outcomes of ML/DLmodels for robustifying them against adversarial attacks.An approach utilizing the interpretability of deep modelsfor the detection of adversarial examples for face recog-nition task is presented in a recent study [170]. The keyaspect of this method is that it identifies critical neuronsfor the individual task by initiating a bi-directional cor-respondence reasoning between the model’s parametersand its attributes. The activation values of the identifiedneurons are then increased to augment the reasoning partand activation values of other neurons are decreased tomask the uninterpretable part. However, Nicholas Carlinidemonstrated that the aforementioned method utilizingthe interpretability of deep models is not resilient to un-targeted adversarial examples generated using L∞ norm[171].• Masking ML Model: In a recent study [172], a methodfor secure learning is presented in which the problem ofadversarial ML is formulated as learning and maskingproblem. The masking of the deep model was performedby introducing noise in the logit output which success-fully deafened attacks with low distortions.2) Modifying Data: It includes those methods that aimat either modifying the data or its features, commonly usedmethods are described next:• Adversarial (Re-)training: This is a very basic methodthat was originally proposed by Goodfellow et al. forThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Various studies have used thismethod for evaluating the robustness of DL classifiersusing different datasets, e.g., MNIST [173] and ImageNet[167]. However, it has been reported in the literaturethat this method fails to defend against iterative adver-sarial perturbation generation methods like basic iterativemethod (BIM) [174].• Input Reconstruction: The method of transforming ad-versarial examples into legitimate ones by cleaning theadversarial noise is known as input reconstruction. Thetransformed samples have no harmful effect on the infer-ence of deep models. In [175], denoising autoencoder isused for the cleaning of adversarial examples.• Feature Squeezing: Xu et al. [176] proposed featuresqueezing as a defense method against adversarial ex-amples by squeezing the input feature space that an ad-versary can exploit to construct adversarial examples. Toreduce the available feature space to an adversary, authorscombined heterogeneous feature vectors in the originalfeature space into a single space. The feature squeezingwas performed at two levels: (1) smoothing the spatialdomain using local and non-local operations and (2)minimizing color bit depth. Moreover, the performanceevaluation of the proposed defense was performed usingeleven state of the art adversarial perturbation generationmethods using three benchmark datasets (i.e., CIFAR10,MNIST, and ImageNet). However, in a later study, theaforementioned defense method was found to be lesseffective [177].• Features Masking: The method of feature masking wasproposed by Gao et al. [178] that aims at masking themost sensitive features of the input that are susceptibleto adversarial perturbations. The authors added a maskinglayer right before the classification layer (i.e., softmax)that sets the corresponding weights of the sensitive neu-rons to zero.• Developing Adversarially Robust Features: To developadversarially robust features, the connections betweenthe metric of interest and natural spectral geometricalproperty of the dataset has been leveraged in [179].Furthermore, the authors provided empirical evidenceabout the effectiveness of using a spectral approach fordeveloping adversarially robust features.• Manifold Projection: The method of projecting inputsamples on the manifold learned by the generative modelsis known as manifold projection. Song et al. [180] usedgenerative models to clean adversarial noise (pertur-bations) from the adversarial images then the cleanedimages are used as the input to the non-modified model.In a similar study [181], generative adversarial networks(GANs) are used for cleaning of adversarial noise.3) Adding Auxiliary Model(s): In these methods, additionalauxiliary ML/DL models are integrated to robustify the main-stream model, commonly used methods that fall into this classare described in the following paragraphs:• Adversarial Detection: In this method, an additionalbinary classifier is trained to distinguish between theadversarial and original samples that can be regardedas the detector model [182], [183]. In [184], a simpleDNN based detector model is used for the detection ofadversarial examples. Similarly, an outlier class has beenintroduced during the training of a deep model that helpsthe model to detect the adversarial examples belongingto the outlier class.• Ensembling Defenses: The literature suggests that ad-versarial examples can be constructed in multi-facetedfashion. Therefore, to develop an efficient defense methodagainst such adversarial examples, multiple defensestrategies can be integrated sequentially or in parallel[185]. The PixelDefend method is an excellent exampleof an ensemble defense method in which authors used anensemble of two methods, i.e., adversarial detection andinput reconstruction [180]. However, it has been shownthat the ensemble of weak defenses does not necessarilyincrease the robustness of DL models to adversarialattacks [177].• Using Generative ML Models: The idea of defendingagainst adversarial attacks by utilizing generative modelswas firstly presented by Goodfellow et al. [98], however,in the same study the authors presented an alternativehypothesis of ensemble training and articulated that gen-erative training is not sufficient. In [186], adversarialexamples are cleaned using GAN that was trained onthe same dataset. In a similar study [187], a frameworknamed Defense-GAN is presented that is trained on thedistribution of legitimate samples. Defense-GAN findssimilar output during the testing phase without adversarialperturbations that are given as input to the original DLmodel. A summary of the state of the art defense methodsfor making DL models resilient to adversarial attacks ispresented in Table IV.C. Causal Models for HealthcareAsking causal questions in healthcare is a very challengingyet important approach and ideally, causal inferences requireexperiments. But it in healthcare this not always possible, e.g.,if we want to figure out what will happen if a person takes drugA instead of B, we can not experiment it directly on the patientwhich is unethical and can have unintended consequences.Alternatively, retrospective observational data is leveraged totrain models for making counterfactual predictions of whatwe would have observed if we had run an experiment [189].Causality can be deemed in two foundational ways, i.e.,potential outcomes and causal graphical models that requiremanipulating reality. In predictive healthcare, potential out-comes can be treatment, action, and interventions. If the totalnumber of possible treatments is T then we can have Tpossible outcomes and the unit of observation will be a patientwho gets one of the T treatments.In the literature, different approaches have been presentedfor providing causal inferences and reasoning in healthcareThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The use of probabilisticgraphical models to analyze causality in health conditionsfor identification sleep apnea, Alzheimers disease, and heartdiseases is presented in [190]. A comprehensive review ofgraphical causal models can be found in this recent study[191].D. Solutions to Address Distribution ShiftsTo cater with data distribution shift problem various tech-niques have been proposed in the literature (e.g., transferlearning and domain adaptation), which are described next.1) Transfer Learning: The requirement of the availabilityof a large-scale dataset for training DL models capable ofproviding high performances can be partially mitigated usingtransfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique in which amodel trained on a larger dataset is re-trained (fine-tuned) onthe application-specific dataset (relatively smaller in size tothe first one). The aim is to transfer knowledge learned by themodel from one domain (data distribution) to the other domain[192]. However, transfer learning can be problematic forhealthcare applications due to the requirement of sufficientlylarge data for first training and good quality data annotatedby expert clinicians such as radiologists for domain-specifictraining.2) Domain Adaptation: Domain adaptation is the methodof learning a DL model by considering a shift between thetraining (often called as source domain) and test (often calledas target domain) data distributions, i.e., source domain andtarget domain distributions are different. Domain adaptation isa special case of transfer learning that can be particularly use-ful for medical image analysis tasks such as MRI segmentation[136], [193], chest X-ray classification [194], and multi-classAlzheimer disease classification [195], etc. Different facets ofdomain adaptation have been proposed in the literature andcan be broadly categorized as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised domain adaptation methodswhich are described below. Please note that the definition ofdomain adaptation is ambiguous since it may refer to labeleddata being available in the source or target domains and thedefinitions provided below for each method are mostly usedin the literature [196].(a) Supervised Domain Adaptation: This method is similarto a supervised learning strategy with the only differenceof different distributions for source domain and targetdomain data. Supervised domain adaptation is particularlyuseful when a labeled data is available for the targetdomain and generally, the source domain also has labeleddata.(b) Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: In unsupervised do-main adaptation, source domain data is labeled and targetdomain data is unlabeled. An unsupervised domain adap-tation method using reverse flow and adversarial trainingfor generating synthetic medical images is presented in[197]. In addition, the authors used self-regularization forpreserving clinically-relevant features.(c) Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation: In semi-superviseddomain adaptation, labeled source data and partial labeledtarget domain.(d) Self-supervised Domain Adaptation: Self-supervised do-main adaptation methods aims at learning visual modelswithout manual labeling by training generic models usingauxiliary relatively simple tasks (known as pretext tasks).The supervision is provided by modifying the originalThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Towards Responsible MLIn this section, we provide different methods for ensuringresponsible ML and we start by enlisting general responsibleAI practices.1) General Responsible AI Practices: The following aresome recommended AI practices to ensure effective and reli-able AI systems.2• Consider human-centered design approach: To have alarge impact on the system being developed, it is impor-tant to consider the characteristics of the users for truerecommendations.• Evaluate training and monitoring using suitable metrics:Instead of using multiple metrics for evaluation of modeltraining, ensure that the metric is appropriate for thecontext and goals of the systems and consider users’feedback in terms of surveys.• Examine your raw data: The biases and abnormalities inthe datasets (e.g., missing values, class imbalance, andincorrect labels) are directly reflected by the learned MLmodels. To ensure the efficacy of the learning process,careful examination of the raw dataset is necessary whilerespecting the privacy concerns.• Understand limitations of the model and dataset: It iscrucial to understand the capability and limitations of theML model and dataset, e.g., a model trained for detectingcorrelations cannot be used for inferences.• Repetitive Testing: Once developed, ML systems shouldbe tested again and again to ensure that they are workingas intended. Rigorous tests should be performed to under-stand how the individual components of the ML systeminteract with each other. Other similar tests include testingfor input drifts, using gold standard datasets, incorpo-rating a larger sample base, and using quality checkingmechanisms.• Continuous Monitoring and Updating: To ensure theefficient performance of the ML systems deployed inreal-time settings, continued monitoring and updating arerequired to identify and fix various issues encountered inrealistic settings.2) Responsible ML for Healthcare: ML/DL techniqueshave a great potential for clinical applications (e.g.,radiologist-level pneumonia detection [11] and dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer [13], etc.) but their limitedadoption in actual clinical settings indicates that these methodsare not yet optimal and not ready for clinical deployment. Ina recent study [199], Wiens et al. have provided a roadmaptowards safe, meaningful, and responsible ML for healthcareand argued that ML deployment in any field should be carriedout by an interdisciplinary team that may include differentstakeholders from multi disciplines, i.e., knowledge experts,2https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/decision-makers, and users. Examples for an interdisciplinaryteam having different stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystemare presented in Table V. In addition, the authors also identi-fied critical steps to be followed/considered when designing,testing, and deploying ML solutions for healthcare applicationsthat include: (1) choosing the right problems; (2) developinga useful solution; (3) considering ethical implications; (4)rigorously evaluating the model; (5) thoughtfully reportingresults; (6) deploying responsibly; and (7) making it to market.TABLE V: Examples for interdisciplinary teams having differ-ent stakeholders from multiple domains.

Tools and Libraries for Secure and Private MLThe main strength of ensuring secure ML relies on thedevelopment of security tools and algorithms. To ensure thesecurity and privacy of ML models and data, various toolsand libraries have been released so far. For example, Ten-sorFlow Federated,3 which is an open-source framework fordistributed ML/DL that enables training of a global sharedmodel in a federated environment without sharing clients’local data. CrypTen4 is a framework for secure and privacy-preserving ML built on PyTorch that provides secure comput-ing techniques for ML/DL model training and inference usingencrypted data and PyTorch-DP5–a framework of PyTorchfor training DL models with differential privacy. Similarly,OpenMined6–an open-source community offers various toolsand libraries for building privacy-preserving ML models whichare briefly described below.• PySyft7 is python library for encrypted and privacypreserving ML. It extends PyTorch, TensorFlow, andKeras and supports differential privacy, federated learn-ing, multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryp-tion.• PyGrid8 is a platform built on PySyft that provides apeer-to-peer network to collectively train ML models.• SyferText9 is a privacy preserving framework for NLPtasks.3https://www.tensorflow.org/federated4https://github.com/facebookresearch/CrypTen5https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp6https://www.openmined.org/7https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft8https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid9https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferTextThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

OPEN RESEARCH ISSUESIn this section, various open research issues related to thedomain of secure, robust, and private ML for healthcare thatrequire further research attention are presented.A. Interpretable MLAlthough the advancement in ML/DL research has providedsignificant performance improvements over the previous stateof the art methods in terms of performance metrics such asaccuracy, precision, recall, and f1-measure, these advance-ments have made the learning process of modern models verycomplex and are usually deployed as a black-box. These black-box methods fail at providing rational or insights as wellas at explaining their learning behavior and thought processfor making predictions [200]. The aforementioned problem istermed as the interpretability problem of ML in the literature,which is defined as the ability to describe the internal processesof an ML system in a human-understandable manner.Moreover, interpretability of ML/DL techniques is requiredto ensure algorithmic fairness, robustness, and generalizationbased on potentially dispersed data collected from a hetero-geneous population. This can eventually help in the smoothdeployment and functionality of ML/DL systems in realisticsettings. For a critical application like healthcare, the ML/DLmodel is expected to be highly accurate and understandableat the same time. Moreover, it has been argued that clinicalintegration of AI models will require interpretability [201]. Toperform an interpretation of ML models, questions about thefairness of model’s predictions, transparency, and accountabil-ity are considered and interpretation is performed using expla-nation methods for justifying predictions of the model usingvisual, textual, or features information. For instance, Bach etal. presented a pixel-wise explanation method that uses layer-wise relevance propagation for interpreting the predictionsof non-linear classifiers [202]. Similarly, for interpretation ofclassifiers’ predictions, Ribeiro et al. presented a frameworknamed LIME and proposed two methods for interpretability,i.e., learning a local model around the predictions and repre-senting predictions and their explanations in a non-redundantway using a submodular optimization approach. In [203],the use of reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to buildinterpretable decision support systems for heart patients and itlearns what is interpretable to each user by their interactions.One yet common method for interpreting/explaining deepmodels, in particular, CNN is the use of saliency maps [204],[205]. These methods are particularly focused on general ap-plications, however, more research that is specifically focusedon the interpretation of ML/DL systems used in healthcareapplications is required.B. Machine Learning on the EdgeThe advancements in ML research have revolutionized tradi-tional healthcare (as discussed in earlier sections). Healthcareservices will increasingly adopt the utilization of IoT devicesand wearable sensors in the future, particularly with the evolu-tion of smart cities and portable medical devices, e.g., portableMRI scanner. With such proliferation, there is a pressingneed for pushing ML models training and inference on edgedevices. This introduces unique challenges such as limitedhardware and processing capabilities, etc. Moreover, this iscrucial for portal medical devices that are utilized for patientsin critical care as they cannot be moved to fixed medicalequipment in the hospital. The research on enabling ML onedge devices (a.k.a fog) is in the early stages of developmentand requires further attention from the research community.The development of this field will enable to monitor patients ina critical situation and eventually enable continuous behavioralmonitoring for improving individuals’ life-style and timelydetection of diseases.C. Handling Dataset AnnotationTo increase the performance of ML/DL models, one naturalstrategy is to acquire more labeled training data. This requiresthat radiologists and medical experts spend their valuabletime manually annotating medical data, e.g., medical images,signals, and reports. Another important aspect is devisingtrue validation sets that will evaluate the performance of theML/DL models and expose the limitations of these models.Therefore, manual annotation of samples into respective cate-gories is time consuming, costly, and a tidy process. Automaticapproaches should be developed to address this issue and onesuch technique is active learning which can be used to annotateunlabelled data samples.Data from multiple sources should be considered whenperforming annotation for specific clinical applications be-cause single-source data might lack precise structured labels[115]. The integration of multiple source data is an importantapplication of ML in healthcare [206], which is known asphenotyping [207]. NLP techniques and recurrent deep modelscan be used for extracting and integrating rich informationfrom unstructured clinical notes to augment the capacity ofdata annotators.D. Distributed Data Management and MLIn healthcare settings, the data is generated in a distributedfashion, i.e., across different departments within a hospital andeven across different hospitals. This necessitates the efficientmanagement and sharing of distributed data for clinical anal-ysis purposes, particularly using ML/DL models. In general,for developing ML/DL models, it is assumed that completetraining and validation datasets are centrally available andeasily accessible. Therefore, there is an increasing demand todevelop methods for distributed data management and ML.E. Fair and Accountable MLThe literature on analyzing the security and robustness ofML/DL approaches reveals that the outcomes of these mod-els lack fairness and accountability [163]. Whereas ensuringthe fairness and accountability of predictions in life-criticalapplications like healthcare are of paramount importance,the fairness property ensures that the ML model should notfavor certain cases over others. Such discrimination mainlyThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

On the other hand,accountability property is concerned with the interpretationof the predictions. Fairness and accountability will assist indeveloping models robust to biases and imperfections such aspast clinical practicesF. Model-Driven MLAlthough ML, AI, and big data are immensely useful toolsfor healthcare, these tools are not panacea and it is important tobe aware of the associated caveats and pitfalls [200]. Failing torealize this, one can easily fall prey to the dangerous dogmathat data once available in abundance must and will speakfor itself and can handle hypothesis generation as well—which in clinical terms would mean that data mining is suf-ficient and independent of the need of clinical interpretation,external validation, and understanding of data’s provenance[208]. To avoid the various problems that can arise fromimproper use of ML in healthcare, it is important to combinedata-driven methods with hypothesis-driven or model-basedmethods (based on subject matter knowledge) and to bringscientific rigor in these studies. Properly designed experimentsare also necessary for deriving causal explanations. Avenuesfor developing secure and robust ML solutions for healthcarethat are scientifically robust and rigorous requires furtherattention from the community.VI. CONCLUSIONSThe use of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL)models for clinical applications has great potential to transformtraditional healthcare service delivery. However, to ensure a se-cure and robust application of these models in clinical settings,different privacy and security challenges should be addressed.In this paper, we provided an overview of such challenges byformulating the ML pipeline in healthcare and by identifyingdifferent sources of vulnerabilities in it. We also discussedpotential solutions to provide secure and privacy-preservingML for security-critical applications like healthcare. Finally,we presented different open research problems that requirefurther investigation.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThe publication of this article was funded by the QatarNational Library (QNL).

INTRODUCTION Data-driven applications are economic drivers of growth and are becoming essential in many domains, including healthcare, infrastructure, and public policy. The data in- volved is often very sensitive and personal in nature. The importance of protecting the privacy of individuals in a data science ecosystem where large-scale collection and processing are commonplace is central to achieving trans- formational impact. The need to protect personal privacy in the “era of big data”, and the potential to do so successfully in the future, with techniques that allow computation over encrypted data, are widely acknowledged [1], [2]. Industries like healthcare and finance are highly regulated when it comes to data ownership, use and data sharing for analytics. These regulations are always evolving. Organiza- tions that are tasked with custody of personal information, be it patient health or other data, are skeptical of their ability to engage in machine learning (ML), partly due to lack of clarity on policies governing use of such data, and partly due to the fear of unknowingly violating the privacy of individuals that may occur in the process of mining such information [3], [4]. The kind of privacy- preserving machine learning (PPML) solution we offer in this paper can help policy makers understand and explain the potential of ML over encrypted data, and how it may inform future evolution of such regulation. The use of PPML will enable organizations to decrease liability because they will be able to provide ML services over encrypted data, without requiring individuals to expose their personal data to anyone. In many ML applications, one party – such as a health system or an insurer or a third party cloud platform – possesses a trained ML model, and the need or desire arises to make predictions with that ML model for an input that is held by a second party, which could be a customer or a patient. One such example is a physician using a prediction model to estimate the risk of 30-day hospital readmission of a patient [5], [6]. The problem that we address in this paper is how to classify the second party’s input with the first party’s classifier such that, at the end of the interaction, the second party is still the only one who knows what their input looks like, and the first party is still the only one who knows what the classifier looks like. To this end, we use techniques from secure multiparty computation (SMC), an umbrella term for cryptographic approaches that allow two or more parties to jointly com- pute a specified output from their private information in a distributed fashion, without actually revealing the private information to each other [7]. In particular, we work with secret sharing based solutions in which the parties share their information using a linear secret sharing scheme. Next, operations are performed by the parties over the shares till the desired outcome is obtained. The final result can be recovered by combining the final shares, and disclosed as intended, i.e. to one of the parties or to both. While SMC has been hailed as a potential solution to enable PPML [2], [8], very little of it has been put into practice so far [9]. Part of this is due to the fact that while in theory any function can be evaluated on private information from different parties using a secure function evaluation protocol (SFE), the use of conventional SFE protocols typically results in an increase of computation time by up to several orders of magnitude. To enable PPML, domain specific customized SMC techniques need to be developed and implemented. In this paper we describe (1) how we successfully de- signed such cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving classification with tree ensembles [10] – random forests (RFs) and boosted decision trees (boosted DTs) – and (2) how we integrated them in the KenSci ML platform for predicting clinical outcomes of patients. The large majority of the economic value created by AI today stems from supervised learning applications [11]. Within supervised learning, RFs and boosted DTs are among the most common algorithms of choice for data scientists across the world, because of their wide applicability and their state-of-the-art performance. Our focus on tree ensem- bles is therefore intentional: to create a widespread impact on applied ML use-cases that are prevalent today. Acknowl- edging that deployment of PPML solutions requires a non- trivial effort, we describe how the SMC based retooling of the KenSci ML platform required us to rework the KenSci data science workflow. The secure prediction environment has been developed in collaboration with expert physicians at KenSci who currently work with many of the large healthcare systems in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Our system produces the same precision (hit rate) compared to non- encrypted in-the-clear models, while preserving the privacy of patient records and trained machine learning models. Widespread adoption of solutions such as one presented in this paper will have a significant impact on health outcomes and public policy, and enable global health systems to transition to cloud-based ML systems. II. RELATED WORK SMC based Machine Learning. A significant body of work in PPML with SMC has focused on the problem of privacy-preserving training of machine learning models (see, e.g., [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and references therein). Privacy-preserving protocols for predicting with trained ML classifiers – hereafter also referred to as “scoring” – has received far less attention. Non-application specific protocols were designed just lately. Bost et al. [17] introduced privacy- preserving protocols for hyperplane-based, Naive Bayes and DT classifiers, Wu et al. [18] for DTs and RFs, David et al. [19] for hyperplane-based and Naive Bayes classifiers, and De Cock et al. [20] for DTs and hyperplane-based classifiers. De Hoogh et al. [14] had also previously presented a proto- col for privacy-preserving scoring of DTs with categorical attributes. The protocol for privacy-preserving scoring of DTs of De Cock et al. [20] cannot be directly used as a building block to obtain random forests and boosted decision trees. We present in Section III a modified protocol for scoring decision trees that does the job. Regarding tree ensembles, to the best of our knowledge, no protocols have been proposed in the literature for privacy- preserving scoring with boosted DTs. The protocol of Wu et al. [18] for privacy-preserving scoring of RFs relies on an original comparison protocol based on the Paillier encryption scheme and on an oblivious transfer scheme. Both of these building blocks involve expensive public-key cryptography operations. Our solution, on the other hand, only uses additions and multiplications over a finite ring in the online phase. Differential Privacy. Most work and results concerning privacy-preserving data mining are based on differential privacy (DP), a field in cryptography that aims to maximize the accuracy of answers to queries from databases while minimizing the chances of identifying its records. Before releasing statistics of a dataset, noise is added to prevent an adversary from learning information about any particular individual in the dataset from the aggregate statistics [21]. While DP has been proven very useful in ensuring the privacy of information in data, the need to address privacy risks at the level of computations that manipulate data, and the potential of SMC as a suitable technique for this, have recently been acknowledged [1]. The aim of DP in an ML setting is protecting the privacy of information in the dataset used during training, whereas the focus in this paper is on the use of SMC to protect the trained model and the privacy of new user data that is classified with the model. Deployed SMC systems for PPML. In contrast to DP, SMC has come to the attention of the data mining and knowledge discovery community only fairly recently, and deployed prototypes are still few and far between. Notewor- thy are the endeavors of the ICT company Cybernetica who developed the SMC platform Sharemind, and deployed it in privacy-preserving applications for statistical analysis and fraud detection based on tax records in Estonia [22], [23]. As far as we are aware, there are no deployed SMC based systems yet for privacy-preserving training of ML models, nor for scoring, as we present in this paper. Model Extraction Attacks. In the system that we present in this paper, we classify one party’s input with another party’s classifier. At the end of the interaction, the party with the classifier will not have learned anything about the other party’s input, and the party with the input will not have learned anything about the other party’s classifier (other than the depth of the decision trees, see Section III). At that point, the output of the classification (class label) is typically disclosed to the party who gave the input, and this class label in itself can leak information about the model. It has been shown that popular ML model classes like logistic regression, neural networks, and DTs are vulnerable to model inversion attacks [24] and model extraction attacks [25]. In a model inversion attack, an adversary who has black-box query access to the model uses the revealed labels and the associated confidence scores of the classifier to uncover information about individuals in the training data. In a model extraction attack, an adversary uses the same kind of information to reverse engineer the model. Model ensembles, such as the tree ensembles that we use in this paper, are suspected to be more resilient to such extraction attacks, because their output is an aggregate of a number of individual models [25]. Nevertheless, some countermeasures may be needed to prevent a model inversion or model extraction attack, which is beyond the scope of the current paper. Regardless, it should be clear that (1) the SMC solution presented in this paper computes the class label in a fully secure manner; (2) only the label that is revealed to the party with the input after the secure computation might leak some information about the classifier; (3) the party with the classifier does not learn anything about the input of the other party at any point. The privacy of the patient or user who is using the ML scoring service is thus fully protected, even if the trained ML model becomes subject to a model inversion or a model extraction attack. III. CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS A. Problem Description In many ML applications, one party – such as a hospital or an insurance company – possesses a trained ML model, and the need or desire arises to make predictions with that model for an input that is held by a second party, which could be a customer or a patient. Using terminology common in cryptography, we will henceforth refer to the first party as Alice, and the second party as Bob. A commonly adopted approach is for Bob (the user) to give his input to Alice (the company), so that Alice can classify the input and return the predicted class label to Bob and/or follow up with actions derived from the knowledge of the class label. Typical examples are a Netflix customer who discloses his preferences in the form of ratings, in return for personal- ized movie recommendations; a user uploading a photo on Microsoft’s how-old.net to get an estimate of the age of the people in the photo; and a healthcare provider using a clinical outcome prediction tool to estimate the risk of 30- day hospital readmission of a patient. In all these cases, the information of the customer, user, or patient (Bob) is fully disclosed to the first party (Alice) holding the machine learning model. The problem that we address in this paper is how to classify the input held by Bob with the classifier held by Alice in such a way that no one, including Alice, learns Bob’s input. A straightforward solution that might come to mind is for Alice to give her classifier to Bob, so that Bob can classify his input locally on his own machine. While this approach would protect Bob’s privacy, it is in many cases not a viable solution because it violates Alice’s privacy: trained ML models are often proprietary and need to be kept secret in order for the company not loose an important competitive advantage [26]. The challenge faced is therefore how to classify Bob’s input with Alice’s classifier such that, at the end of the interaction, Bob is still the only one who knows what his input looks like, and Alice is still the only one who knows what her classifier looks like. In Section III-D we present a cryptographic protocol for solving the problem above in the case when the classifier is a random forest (RF) or a boosted decision trees (boosted DTs) model. We consider honest-but-curious, static adver- saries, like other privacy-preserving classification protocols so far. A static adversary chooses the set of corrupted parties before the protocol execution. An honest-but-curious adversary follows the instructions of the protocol, but tries to gather additional information. We use as a building block an adaptation of the protocol for privacy-preserving scoring of DTs of De Cock et al. [20], which we recall in Section III-C, after presenting preliminaries about the security model in Section III-B. B. Cryptographic Preliminaries and Building Blocks Security Model: We consider the security of our pro- tocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework [7], [27] due to the fact that this framework considers the security of the protocols under arbitrary composition (i.e., multiple copies of the protocol can be run concurrently to themselves and to other protocols), which covers environments like the Internet. It is the default model for considering the security of cryptographic protocols nowadays. The UC composition theorem ensures that a protocol that is proven UC-secure can be securely executed in such environments. Additionally, the UC framework allows the modular design of complex protocols. A version of the UC composition theorem for the setting with honest-but-curious, static adversaries, is given by Cramer et. al. [7, Theorem 4.20]. Commodity-based Model: The commodity-based model [28] is a setup assumption about the existence of a trusted initializer that pre-distributes correlated randomness during an initialization phase (which can happen far before the protocol execution, even before knowing the inputs) to the parties participating in the protocol. The trusted initializer is not involved in any other part of the execution and does not learn any input from the parties. The main advantage of this model is that it enables very efficient solutions with unconditional security. The commodity-based model allows the realization of non-trivial functionality in the UC framework and has already been used to get very efficient secure computation protocols for tasks such as computing inner-products [29], [30] and other linear algebra operations [31], string equality [30], set intersection [30], oblivious polynomial evaluation [32] and verifiable secret sharing [33]. It was used in protocols for PPML [15], [19], [20]. In practice, this correlated randomness can be distributed by: (1) a single trusted server, (2) many not completely trusted servers (only a majority of honest servers is necessary [28]), or (3) pre-computed by the parties in an offline phase using an SMC protocol to emulate the trusted initializer (in this case the advantage is in offloading the heavy computation to be run at any idle time). Secret Sharing: We perform SMC using additively secret sharings to do computations modulo q. A value x is secret shared over Zq = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} between two parties Alice and Bob by picking xA, xB ∈ Zq uniformly at random subject to the constraint that x = xA+xB mod q, and then revealing xA to Alice and xB to Bob. This secret sharing will be denoted by JxK q , which can be thought of as a shorthand for (xA, xB). Notice that from the point of view of Alice (resp., of Bob), no information about x is revealed by xA (resp., by xB). A secret shared value x can be revealed to one party by sending him the share of the other party. Building Blocks: We use as a building block Beaver’s protocol [34] for multiplication of numbers, denoted by piDM . If two parties Alice and Bob each have shares xA, yA, xB , and yB of numbers x and y, then they can follow protocol piDM to compute shares zA and zB of z = x · y. We also use the protocol piDC for performing secure distributed bitwise comparison due to Garay et al. [35] with secret sharings in the field Z2. In this case, Alice and Bob have bitwise shares of two numbers x and y, which are expressed as bit strings of length l, and they follow the protocol to determine whether x ≥ y. piDC outputs a secret sharing of 1 if x ≥ y and of 0 otherwise. Finally we use the protocols for oblivious input selection piOIS and for secure argmax piargmax of De Cock et al. [20]. In the case of piOIS , Alice has as input a vector of values, x = (x1, . . . , xn), in which each value is expressed as a bit string of length l. Bob has as input k, the index of the desired input value xk. At the end of the protocol, Alice and Bob have a secret sharing of zi over Z2, for i = 1, . . . , l, which are the bits that make up xk. Bob has not learned any of the values of Alice’s vector x, and Alice has not learned which index k Bob was interested in. In the case of piargmax, Alice and Bob have as input bitwise shares of m values that need to be compared. At the end of the protocol, they have a secret sharing of the index of the largest value. For the proof that these protocols are correct and UC-secure against honest-but-curious adversaries in the commodity-based model, and for the description of opti- mizations of these protocols (and also for more details), we refer to [20], [36]. We use the same fixed-point representa- tion of Catrina and Saxena [37] to deal with real numbers (i.e., fixed-point precision real numbers are mapped into integers). C. Decision Trees For privacy-preserving scoring with decision trees, we propose a novel protocol that improves the method proposed in [20]. In [20], Bob has an input feature vector x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn and Alice has a single decision tree used to classify Bob’s feature vector. At the end of the privacy- preserving scoring protocol in [20], the inferred class label is opened to Bob. The case that we consider in this paper is more general: instead of a single decision tree, Alice has an ensemble of decision trees, that have each been trained to output probabilities associated with the class labels (as opposed to only the class labels themselves, as in [20]). Bob should not learn the class label inferred by each individual tree from the ensemble for his input, or their probabilities; only the aggregated result should be disclosed to Bob (see Section III-D). The privacy-preserving scoring protocol piDT for DTs from [20] cannot be directly used in that scenario. We propose a new protocol for scoring decision trees that is different from the one in [20] in two ways: (1) at the end of piDT the output is not opened towards Bob, but instead it is kept as a secret sharing to perform further computations; and (2) instead of having a category associated with each leaf node of the decision tree, we have a probability vector over the class labels, i.e. a class distribution, associated with each leaf node. By using the novel protocol as a building block, we can them obtain privacy preserving scoring of random forests and boosted decision trees. As stated above, Bob has as input his feature vector x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn. Alice has an ensemble of decision trees, in which each tree is a model D = (d,G,H,w), where d is the depth of the tree, G maps the leaves to the class output ci, i = 1, · · · , k. Each class output is associated with a class distribution. H maps branch nodes (always considered in level-order) to input features and w is a vector of thresholds. An example of a DT of depth d = 3 is depicted in Figure 1. It is assumed without loss of generality that the binary tree is full, i.e. that it contains all 2d − 1 internal nodes (branch nodes) and 2d leaf nodes. A decision tree can always be filled with dummy nodes to make it full. To this end, a leaf that occurs at level s < d is expanded into a subtree of depth d−s in which all the leaves are copies of the original leaf, and the branch nodes contain a new dummy feature with a randomly chosen threshold. Note that this can be done offline by Alice, before she engages in any privacy- preserving scoring protocol. Each branch node of a decision tree tests the value of x2 ≥ w1 x1 ≥ w3 x3 ≥ w7 c1 : 0.2 c2 : 0.7 c3 : 0.1 c1 : 0.2 c2 : 0.2 c3 : 0.6 z7 = 1 z7 = 0 x4 ≥ w6 c1 : 0.1 c2 : 0.0 c3 : 0.9 c1 : 0.0 c2 : 0.6 c3 : 0.4 z6 = 1 z6 = 0 z3 = 1 z3 = 0 x3 ≥ w2 x2 ≥ w5 c1 : 0.1 c2 : 0.8 c3 : 0.1 c1 : 0.9 c2 : 0.1 c3 : 0.0 z5 = 1 z5 = 0 x1 ≥ w4 c1 : 0.1 c2 : 0.7 c3 : 0.2 c1 : 0.8 c2 : 0.2 c3 : 0.0 z4 = 1 z4 = 0 z2 = 1 z2 = 0 z1 = 1 z1 = 0 Figure 1. Example of a decision tree of depth d = 3 for a classification problem with three classes c1, c2 and c3. Secure Decision Tree Protocol piDT Alice has as input a decision tree model D = (d,G,H,w) and Bob has a feature vector x. Alice and Bob proceed as follows: 1) For i = 1, . . . , 2d−1, Alice and Bob obtain bitwise secret sharings of xH(i) by using piOIS with inputs x1, · · · , xn from Bob and input H(i) from Alice. 2) Let [pD(c1), pD(c2), . . . , pD(ck)] be a class distribution vector in which pD(ci) is the probability that x belongs to class ci according to decision tree D. There will be one class distribution vector per possible output of the tree. 3) Alice multiplies the probabilities in the leaf nodes of each decision tree D by a confidence factor α offline. Alice them maps these real numbers as integers according to the procedure in [20] and bit-wise shares the resulting weighted probability vectors pi = [α · pD(c1), α · pD(c2), . . . , α · pD(ck)] with Bob, for i = 1, . . . , 2d − 1. 4) For i = 1, . . . , 2d − 1, Alice and Bob securely compare xH(i) and wi. For the input wi, Alice inputs its bit representation and Bob inputs zeros. Let JziK2 denote the result. 5) For j = 0, . . . , 2d − 1, let jd . . . j1 be the binary representation of j with d bits and let bk . . . b1 be the one-hot encoding of G(j + 1)− 1. For r = 1, . . . , k, initialize Jyj,rK2 with the shares (0, br). Initialize u = 1 and s = d. While s > 0 do: a) For r = 1, . . . , k, Jyj,rK2 ← Jyj,rK2(JzuK2 + js). b) Update u← 2u+ js and s← s− 1. 6) For all r = 1, . . . , k compute JσrK2 ←∑2d−1j=0 Jyj,rK2 7) Alice and Bob secure compute qi = [σ1 ·α·pD(c1), σ2 ·α·pD(c2), . . . , σk ·α·pD(ck)] with Bob, for i = 1, . . . , 2d−1 by using piDM . Alice and Bob securely add all the resulting vectors qi component-wise producing the secret sharingJpK 2 of the weighted probability vector p, the desired output. Figure 2. The protocol for secure scoring of a decision tree a particular feature xH(i) against a specified threshold wi and branches according to the results. Let zi be the Boolean variable denoting the result of the comparison, i.e. zi = 1 if xH(i) ≥ wi, and zi = 0 otherwise. Each leaf node specifies a probability distribution over the k possible classes c1, . . . , ck. The classification algorithm for a stand-alone decision tree proceeds as follows: • Starting from the root node, for the current branch node vi, evaluate zi. If zi = 1, take the left branch; otherwise, the right branch. • When a leaf node is reached, output G(j), where j is the index of the leaf, and G(j) the class distribution corresponding to that leaf, and terminate. Inspired by the ideas of Bost et al. [17], we per- form inference with a decision tree D by evaluating a polynomial PD: {0, 1}2d−1→{1, . . . , 2d}. On input z = (z1, . . . , z2d−1), PD gives the index of the selected leaf level. This polynomial is a sum of terms such that each term corresponds to one possible path in the tree. Given z, the term corresponding to the path taken by x in the tree evaluates to the inference result (i.e., the index of the leaf), while the remaining terms evaluate to zero. Similar as in [20], the idea of the secure protocol piDT for scoring decision trees (see Figure Figure 2) is that, for each branch node, Alice and Bob use the oblivious input selection protocol piOIS to obtain bitwise secret sharings of the value xH(i) that will be compared against the threshold wi of this node. piOIS guarantees that Bob does not learn which feature will be used in the comparison at each branch node, and also that Alice does not learn the values of the features. Then the comparisons are performed using the secure distributed comparison protocol piDC in order to obtain z, which is then used to evaluate the polynomial PD using the secure multiplication protocol piDM and local addition of secret sharings. The only information leaked about the tree structure to Bob is its depth d. The full description of protocol piDT is given in Figure 2. The proof that the decision tree protocol piDT is correct and UC-secure against honest-but-curious adversaries in the commodity- based is simmilar to the one in [20], [36]. D. Tree Ensembles We assume that Alice has an ensemble of decision trees D1, D2, . . . , Dm, each with an associated confidence factor or weight α1, α2, . . . , αm, and Bob wants to classify his input x = (x1, . . . , xn) with this ensemble. For each tree Dj individually, the inference algorithm produces a class distribution vector [pDj (c1), pDj (c2), . . . , pDj (ck)] in which pDj (ci) is the probability that x belongs to class ci according to decision tree Dj . To obtain a final classification result, these intermediate results are aggregated as follows: c = arg k max i=1 m∑ j=1 αj · pDj (ci) (1) i.e. the predicted label is that of the class with the highest weighted average of probabilities among the individual decision trees. In the case of random forests, all αj’s are usually 1, while in boosted decision tree models the αj’s can vary, reflecting the confidence in each tree as a correct classifier. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Alice multiplies the probabilities in the leaf nodes of each decision tree Dj with αj offline, before engaging in any computation with Bob. As a result, the outcome of the pro- tocol piDT will be secret sharings of the weighted probability vectors pj = [αj · pDj (c1), αj · pDj (c2), . . . , αj · pDj (ck)] thereby stripping away the need for computationally more expensive secure multiplications of the tree weights with the class probabilities. Our solution for obtaining this final class label in a privacy-preserving manner then works as follows. First, for each tree Dj in the ensemble we use the protocol piDT for scoring x, obtaining as a result a secret sharing of the weighted probability vector, i.e. the probability vector multiplied by the weight αj of the tree Dj . After that, a secure bitwise addition protocol [38] is used to add these weighted vectors and obtain one accumulator for each of the possible categories (note that these accumulators are still kept as secret sharings). Finally, the secure argmax protocol is executed with these accumulators as input to obtain the most likely category. The full description of protocol piTE is in Figure 3. The security of protocol piTE follows from the UC- security of the building blocks using the UC composition theorem. IV. SYSTEM DESIGN A. The KenSci Platform KenSci has developed a novel healthcare-specific AI plat- form where standardized ML models are used by customers as templates to enable end-to-end solutions for various problems across care management, cost predictions, and operational efficiency in health systems. The design of this platform required KenSci to solve non-traditional ML challenges such as feature standardization for healthcare, data integration across multiple data sources, and setting up cloud-based scalable data pipelines, subject to the constraint that all services need to be compliant with various regulatory standards. Over the years, KenSci has developed many ML models for various use cases, as well as proprietary model orchestration components to be able to score these models at scale on datasets that may contain PHI (protected health information). KenSci also developed innovative ways to ex- pose ML model end-points to backward integrate into health IT systems that are prevalent in the healthcare systems. Figure 4 and 5 present a high level system overview of a KenSci deployment service for model scoring. Both diagrams depict a server (Alice) with a model bank of classifiers, and a client (Bob/Healthcare System) that wishes to risk-stratify and score patient data. The KenSci healthcare AI platform acts as an intermediary. Figure 4 depicts the traditional process where the client’s data is encrypted at- rest, say in a database, at the client side, as well as in- transit to the server’s side. At server side, the data is then decrypted before classification, and a score or class label is generated. This class label or score is then encrypted and returned to the client side, where it is again subsequently decrypted. The next Figure 5 depicts our approach using the cryptographic protocols presented in Section III where the data is kept encrypted during computation as well, in addition to the traditional encryption at-rest (in storage) and in-transit. The fundamental difference between the two approaches in Figure 4 and 5, is that with the approach in Figure 5, the client’s data is never exposed to the ML model server. In-the-clear scoring (Figure 4) can operate without the use of sessions initiated by KenSci between the client and the server; the client can provide all of the required inputs to a traditional model, and receive a score in response. Invocation of the privacy-preserving execution environment as described in Figure 5 requires iterative back-and-forth communication between the client and the server during the scoring operation. To accomplish this, we must guarantee Secure Tree Ensemble Protocol piTE Alice has as input decision tree models D1, . . . , Dm, with Dj = (dj , Gj , Hj ,wj), and Bob has a feature vector x. Alice and Bob proceed as follows: 1) For each of the trees D1, . . . , Dm in the ensemble, use the protocol piDT to obtain a secret sharing JpjK2 of the weighted probability vector pj . 2) Compute JaK 2 ←∑jJpjK2 using a protocol for secure bitwise addition [38]. 3) The secure argmax protocol piargmax is run with the k elements of a as input and Bob obtains the most likely category as output. Figure 3. The protocol for secure scoring of a tree ensemble Figure 4. KenSci ML Platform deployment with “in-the-clear” scoring. Data is encrypted during storage and transit, but decrypted before model scoring. Data and models both reside in the customer’s cloud subscription. Figure 5. KenSci ML Platform deployment with privacy-preserving scoring. Data is encrypted at-rest (in storage), in-transit, and for scoring computations. that the intermediate state about the scoring operation is held on both sides of the connection, and the model bank is built in a way to allow this run-time communication. Our solution uses a session-style approach, pairing a client with a model service in favor of other implementations. We have also designed a solution that maintains the tally of calculations done on the model side in a database store on the model cluster, such that any model server can respond to a client’s request. B. From Standard to Encrypted Model Format As part of our deployment framework we created a capability that allows us to accept any tree-based classifier into the encrypted model bank of the privacy-preserving model execution environment at KenSci. Different adapters were used to convert from native R, Python, or the Predictive Model Markup Language PMML, to the format required by the privacy-preserving model execution environment. These adapters work by iteratively traversing the model’s branches (or multiple trees) to produce a standardized representation. Ultimately, the nature of the model’s tree (nodes and their weights) must be communicated. Once this format has been produced, it can be associated with the appropriate metadata about a model (model identifier, performance characteristics, and so on) and made consumable to clients. Decision trees, random forests and boosted decision tree models are all stored as a TreeModel data structure, repre- sented as a dictionary, and saved as a JSON string. This TreeModel contains a list of the class labels, the input features that the model requires, the weights/confidence of the trees, and a list of the trees themselves. The ‘weights’ field only exists if the model is a boosted decision tree model. The ‘classes’ field is a list of the resulting labels the model can produce. For each tree in the ensemble, TreeModel contains the following properties: • Features: A list of the feature names for each node in the tree, in level-order. For the tree in Figure 1, this list is [x2, x3, x1, x1, x2, x4, x3]. The same feature can occur more than once. The function H(i) returns the index of the input feature for node i, e.g. H(5) = 2. The ith feature corresponds to the ith threshold. There can be duplicate features, but each feature/threshold pair is a unique tuple and generally represents a unique node. Sometimes you may have nodes in different parts of the tree with identical feature/threshold values. We only need to store the tuple once. Let fi represent the feature name of the ith node. Let the function H(i) return the index of the input feature for node i. • Thresholds: A list of the thresholds for each node of the tree. For the tree in Figure 1, this list is [w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7]. The ith threshold, denoted by wi, corresponds to the ith feature. There can be duplicate thresholds, but each feature/threshold pair is a unique tuple. Let ti represent the threshold value of the ith node. • Depth: It is an integer that represents the depth of the tree. • Classifiers: An array of arrays where each internal array maps to the leaf of the tree whose nodal path is represented by the corresponding internal array of the ‘polynomial’ field. So the ith array of the ‘classifier’ field is the votes of the leaf attained by the threshold comparison of every node listed in the ith array of the ‘polynomial’ field evaluating to 1. The length of each internal array is the same as the length of the ‘classes’ field in the TreeModel, since each element of the classifier’s internal arrays is that leaf’s vote to the corresponding class. In other words, each internal array corresponds to the probability distri- bution over the class labels in the leaf of a tree. Let classifier[i][c] be the vote for class c from leaf i. For the tree in Figure 1 this array is [[0.8, 0.2, 0.0], [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.0, 0.6, 0.4], [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], [0.2, 0.2, 0.6], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]]. C. Implementation We now present detailed information about the implemen- tation of our protocol described in Section III-D. 1) Requested model and data are piped into the ClientSide secure multiparty computation DT/RF/ADA evaluator as a json string in the following format: {“cmd” : “score”, “modelName” : “name”, “modelID” : “id”, “data” : {“feature1” : value1, . . . , “featuren” : valuen}}. The model name and id are model identifiers used to identify exactly which type of model the client is requesting. 2) The ClientSide evaluator sends the ServerSide evaluator the list of variable names in their given order of evaluation: [“feature1”, . . . , “featuren”] v 3) Score model. If the model is an Adaboost model and has tree confidence values, we multiply these weights into the classifiers of each tree before starting the multiparty computation scoring on data. Each tree can be scored in parallel, but in our current deployments the tree scoring is serial. a) For each tree, the ServerSide evaluator sends the di- mensions of the ‘polynomial’ field to the ClientSide evaluator. This leaks the depth of the tree - the only information that the client ever learns about the model. b) For i = 1, . . . , 2d−1, the client and the server obtain bitwise secret sharings of xH(i) by executing the protocol piOIS with inputs x1, . . . ;xn from the client and input H(i) from the server. c) For i = 1, ..., 2d − 1, securely compare xH(i) and wi. For the input wi, the server inputs its bit representation and the client inputs zeros. Let [[zi]]2 denote the result. d) Create a two dimensional array y such that y[i] contains the bitwise shares of the one hot encod- ing of G(i + 1) − 1 for i = 0, . . . , 2d − 1. For i = 0, . . . , 2d−1, iteratively multiply every bit in y[i] d times where d is the depth of the tree according to Step 5 in Secure Decision Tree protocol in Figure 2. e) For j = 0, . . . , 2d − 1, add the bit shares of y[j] as TreeOutput[r] = ∑2d−1 j=0 y[j][r] according to Step 6 in Figure 2. Both the evaluators now hold the shares of the one hot encoding of the output leaf. f) For i = 0, . . . , 2d − 1, do secure bitwise multi- plication of the i′th bit in the tree output with the bit representation of the weighted probability vectors of (i + 1)′th leaf. Do a bitwise addition of the weighted probability vectors of 2d leaf nodes. The evaluators now hold the bitwise shares of the weighted probability vector corresponding to the tree output. g) When all the trees have been scored and the shares of each final classifier have been calculated, the cor- responding ‘votes’ from each tree are added together via bitwise addition. h) Perform the secure argmax function to select the index k of the highest vote. i) Open k to the client. The client can then get class[k] from the known list of classes. V. PERFORMANCE The overall runtime of the protocol is O(2d · l · log(l)), where l is the bit length used for the feature values, the thresholds in the branch nodes, and the probabilities, and d is the depth of the decision trees. The round complexity, i.e. the number of sequential steps in the protocol (discounting on operations that can be done in parallel) is O(log l). To illustrate the practical runtime performance, we apply the protocol to predict the risk that patients run to get an infection after surgery using tree ensemble models as described in [39]. Each patient is characterized by a vector with 94 features, namely their gender, age, and 92 features derived from blood tests done prior to surgery. The task is to predict whether the patient will develop an infection after surgery or not. Table I shows the time it takes to classify a patient in a privacy-preserving manner with AdaBoost models (ADA) and random forests (RF), with a varying number of trees (10, 50, 100). The predictive accuracy is the same as when classifying without any encryption (i.e. an AUC of around 85%, depending on the model), since the cryptographic protocols perform the same operations as the traditional, unencrypted classification algorithms, thereby obtaining the same class labels. The experiments were run on a 64 bit Linux virtual machine with 72 vCPUs and 144 GB RAM. Table I TIME REQUIRED TO CLASSIFY A PATIENT IN A PRIVACY-PRESERVING MANNER; AVERAGE RUNTIME OVER 3 RUNS Model Number of Trees Depth of Trees Runtime (sec) ADA 10 1 3 ADA 50 1 10 ADA 100 1 19 RF 10 4 18 RF 50 4 84 RF 100 4 160 Each experiment was repeated 3 times, and the average runtime is recorded in Table I. In the ADA models, by default, each of the trees in the trained models is a decision stump, i.e. a tree of depth 1. In RF models, each tree is of depth d = 4. In all models, the number of bits used for the representation of numbers is l = 30. As the experiments show, the runtime grows with the number of trees as well as with the depth of the trees. With an AdaBoost model of 50 trees, which was the best model in [39], it takes approximately 10 sec to make a prediction for a patient in a fully privacy-preserving manner, allowing secure predictions for 360 patients per hour on a single machine. VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we have presented the first secure multiparty computation (SMC) enabled cryptographic protocols for private classification with tree ensembles – random forests and boosted decision trees – and the deployment of our protocols in the KenSci healthcare analytics platform. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first time a SMC-based privacy-preserving machine learning protocol goes live in a real world scenario. Techniques such as the ones here presented are making it increasingly clear that sacrificing privacy for the benefits of Big Data and AI shouldn’t be necessary. From a technological perspective, SMC makes privacy-preserving machine learning possible. The field is still in its infancy, and deployed solutions are few and far between. Our results help bringing this exciting field a step closer to practical use. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Kyle Fritchman was employed at KenSci, Inc. while conducting this work.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM Contemporary data collection and linking capabilities, combined with the growing diversity of the data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) techniques, and the broader deployment of these techniques in data science and analytics, have had a profound impact on decision-making across many areas of human endeavors. In this context, public healthcare sets priority requirements toward the robustness, security (Qayyum et al., 2021), and interpretability (Stiglic et al., 2020) of ML solutions. We use the term solution to denote the algorithmic decision-making scenarios involving ML and AI algorithms (Davenport and Kalakota, 2019). While the early AI solutions for healthcare, like expert systems, possessed limited explanatory mechanisms (Darlington, 2011), these mechanisms proved to have an important role in clinical decision-making and, hence, made healthcare practitioners, clinicians, health economists, patients, and other stakeholders aware about the need to have such capabilities. Healthcare domain imposes a broad spectrum of unique challenges to contemporary ML solutions, placing much higher demands with respect to interpretability, comprehensibility, explainability, fidelity, and performance of ML solutions (Ahmad et al., 2018). Among these properties of ML solutions, interpretability is particularly important for human-centric areas like healthcare, where it is crucial for the end users to not only have access to an accurate model but also to trust the validity and accuracy of the model, as well as understand how the model works, what recommendation has been made by the model, and why. These aspects have been emphasized by a number of recent studies, most notably in Caruana et al. (2015) and Holzinger et al. (2017), and summarized in the study by Ahmad et al. (2018). Healthcare, similar to government and business digital services, manufacturing with its industrial internet of things and creative industries, experienced the much celebrated manifestations of “big data,” “small data,” “rich data,” and the increased impact of ML solutions operating with these data. Consequently, the interpretability of such solutions and the explainability of the impact of the judgements they assist to make or have made and, where needed, the rationale of recommended actions and behavior are becoming essential requirements of contemporary analytics, especially in society-critical domains of health, medical analysis, automation, defense, security, finance, and planning. This shift has been further accentuated by the growing worldwide commitment of governments, industries, and individual organizations to address their endeavors toward the UnitedNations Sustainable Development Goals1 and by the data- dependent scientific and technological challenges faced by the rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The later challenges highlight and reinforce the central role of healthcare, backed by science, technology, lateral thinking, and innovative solutions in societal and economic recovery. Some state-of-the-art overviews, such as Doshi-Velez andKim (2017) and Gilpin et al. (2019) related to interpretability, as well 1https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ and https://sdgs.un.org/goals. as more method-focused papers, like Lipton (2018) and Molnar et al. (2019), tend to use interpretability and explainability interchangeably. They also report that the interpretability of ML solutions and the underlying models is not well-defined. The study related to interpretability is scattered throughout a number of disciplines, such as AI, ML, human-computer interaction (HCI), visualization, cognition, and social sciences (Miller, 2019), to name a few of the areas. In addition, the current research seems to focus on particular categories or techniques instead of addressing the overall concept of interpretability. Recent systematic review studies, Gilpin et al. (2018) and Mittelstadt et al. (2019), have clarified some differences and relationships between interpretability and explainability in the context of ML and AI. In these domains, interpretability refers to the degree of human interpretability of a given model, including “black box” models (Mittelstadt et al., 2019). Machine interpretability of the outcomes of ML algorithms is treated separately. Explanability refers primarily to the number of ways to communicate an ML solution to others (Hansen and Rieger, 2019), i.e., the “ways of exchanging information about a phenomenon, in this case the functionality of a model or the rationale and criteria for a decision, to different stakeholders.” Both properties of ML solutions are central to the broader adoption of such solutions in diverse high-stake healthcare scenarios, e.g., predicting the risk of complications to the health condition of a patient or the impact of treatment change. While some authors (for instance, Hansen and Rieger, 2019; Mittelstadt et al., 2019; Samek and Müller, 2019) consider interpretability as an important component of explainability of ML solutions in AI, we view interpretability and explainability as complementary to each other, with interpretability being fundamental in ensuring trust in the results, transparency of the approach, confidence in deploying the results, and, where needed, quality of the maintenance of ML solutions. Further, in this study, we used the term interpretability in a broader sense, which subsumes communication and information exchange aspects of explainability. We considered two connected aspects of the development of the overall concept of interpretability in ML solutions: 1. methods, which include the range of interpretable ML algorithms and interpretability solutions for AI/ML algorithms; 2. methodologies in data science, which consider explicitly the achievement of the necessary (for the project) interpretability of the ML solutions. There is a wide collection of interpretable ML methods and methods for the interpretation of ML models. Murdoch et al. (2019) provide a compact and systematic approach toward their categorization and evaluation. Methods are categorized into model-based and post-hoc interpretation methods. They are evaluated using predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, the PDR framework (Murdoch et al., 2019), where relevancy is evaluated against human audience. The framework also provides common terminology for practitioners. Guidotti et al. (2018) and Carvalho et al. (2019) provide extensive systematic overviews with elaborate frameworks of the state- of-the-art of interpretability methods. Mi et al. (2020) provide Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare broader taxonomy and comparative experiments, which can help practitioners in selecting suitable models with complementary features for addressing interpretability problems inML solutions. Model interpretability and explainability are crucial for clinical and healthcare practice, especially, since not only non- linear models but also inherently more interpretable ones, like decision trees, if large and complex, become difficult to comprehend (Ahmad et al., 2018). On the other hand, working with data in the healthcare domain is complex at every step, starting from establishing and finding the relevant, typically numerous, diverse, and heterogeneous data sources required to address the research objective; integrating andmapping these data sources; identifying and resolving data quality issues; pre-processing and feature engineering without losing information or distorting it; and finally using the resulting high-dimensional, complex, sometimes unstructured, data to build a high-performing interpretable model. This complexity further supports the argument for the development of ML methodologies which explicitly embed interpretability through the data science project life cycle and ensure the achievement of the level of interpretability of ML solutions that had been agreed for the project. Interpretability of an ML solution can serve a variety of stakeholders involved in data science projects in connection with the implementation of their outcomes. Interpretability of an ML solution can serve a variety of stakeholders, involved in data science projects and related to the implementation of their outcomes in algorithmic decision making (Berendt and Preibusch, 2017). For instance, the human-centric visual analytics methodology “Extract- Explain-Generate” for interrogating biomedical data (Kennedy et al., 2008) explicitly relates different stakeholders (molecular biologist, clinician, analysts, and managers) with specific areas of knowledge extraction and understanding associated with the management of patients. This study is focused on addressing the methodological challenges and opportunities of broad embedding of interpretability (including the selection of methods of interpretability that are appropriate for a project, given its objectives and constraints). 2. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CREATING METHODOLOGIES WHICH CONSISTENTLY EMBED INTERPRETABILITY In order to progress with the adoption of ML in healthcare, a consistent and comprehensive methodology is needed: first, to minimize the risk of project failures, and second, to establish and ensure the needed level of interpretability of the ML solution while addressing the above-discussed diverse requirements to ML solutions. The rationale supporting these needs is built on a broader set of arguments about: – the high proportion of data science project failures, including those in healthcare; – the need to support an agreed level of interpretability and explainability of ML solutions; – the need for consistent measurement and evaluation of interpretability of ML solutions; and – the emerging need for standard methodology, which explicitly embeds mechanisms to manage the achievement of the level of interpretability of ML solutions required by stakeholders through the project. Further, in this section, we use these arguments as dimensions around which we elaborate the challenges and opportunities for the design of cross-industry data science methodology, which is capable of handling interpretability of ML solutions under the complexity of the healthcare domain. 2.1. High Proportion of Data Science Project Failures Recent reports, which include healthcare-related organizations, estimate that up to 85% of data science/ML/AI projects do not achieve their stated goals. The latest NewVantage Partners Big Data and AI Executive Survey, based on the responses from C-Executives from 85 blue-chip companies of which 22% are from Healthcare and Life Sciences, noted that only 39% of companies are managing data as an asset (NewVantage Partners LLC, 2021). Fujimaki (2020) emphasized that “the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on data science and BI teams to deliver more with less. In this type of environment, AI/ML project failure is simply not acceptable.” On the other hand, the NewVantage Partners survey (NewVantage Partners LLC, 2021) emphasized that, over the 10 years of conducting these surveys, organizations continue to struggle with their transformation into data-driven organizations, with only 29% achieving transformational business outcomes. Only 24% have created a data-driven organization, a decline from 37.8%, and only 24% have forged a data culture (NewVantage Partners LLC, 2021), a result which, to a certain extent, is counterintuitive to the overall expectation of the impact of AI technologies to decision- making and which projected benefits from the adoption of such technologies. A number of sources (e.g., vander Meulen and Thomas, 2018; Kaggle, 2020; NewVantage Partners LLC, 2021) established that a key reason for these failures is linked to the lack of proper process and methodology in areas, such as requirement gathering, realistic project timeline establishment, task coordination, communication, and designing a suitable project management framework (see also Goodwin, 2011; Stieglitz, 2012; Espinosa and Armour, 2016). Earlier works have suggested (see, e.g., Saltz, 2015) that improved methodologies are needed as the existing ones do not cover many important aspects and tasks, including those related to interpretability (Mariscal et al., 2010). Further, studies have shown that the biased focus on the tools and systems has limited the ability to gain value from the effort of organizational analytics effort (Ransbotham et al., 2015) and that data science projects need to increase their focus on process and task coordination (Grady et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2015; Espinosa and Armour, 2016). A recent Gartner Consulting report also emphasizes the role of processes and methodology (Chandler and Oestreich, 2015) and practitioners agree with this view (for examples and analyses from diverse practical perspectives see Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare Goodson, 2016; Arcidiacono, 2017; Roberts, 2017; Violino, 2017; Jain, 2019). 2.2. Support for the Required Level of Interpretability and Explainability of ML Solutions In parallel with the above-discussed tendencies, there is pressure on the creation of frameworks/methodologies, which can ensure the necessary interpretability for sufficient explainability of the output of the ML solutions. While it has been suggested, in recent years, that it is only a matter of time before ML will be universally used in healthcare, building ML solutions in the health domain proves to be challenging (Ahmad et al., 2018). On the one hand, the demands for explainability, model fidelity, and performance in general in healthcare are much higher than in most other domains (Ahmad et al., 2018). In order to build the trust in ML solutions and incorporate them in routine clinical and healthcare practice, medical professionals need to clearly understand how and why an ML solution-driven decision has been made (Holzinger et al., 2017; Vellido, 2020). This is further affected by the fact that the ML algorithms that achieve a high level of predictive performance, e.g., boosted trees (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or deep neural networks (Goodfellow et al., 2016), are quite complex and usually difficult to interpret. In fact, some researchers argue that performance and interpretability of an algorithm are in reverse dependence (Ahmad et al., 2018; Molnar et al., 2019). Additionally, while there are a number of techniques aiming to explain the output of the models that are not directly interpretable, as many authors note (e.g., Holzinger et al., 2017; Gilpin et al., 2019; Rudin, 2019; Gosiewska et al., 2020), current explanatory approaches, while promising, do not seem to be sufficiently mature. Molnar et al. (2019) found that the reliability of some of these methods deteriorates if the number of features is large or if the level of feature interactions is high, which is often the case in health data. Further, Gosiewska and Biecek (2020) showed that current popular methods for explaining the output of ML models, like SHAP (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) and LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), produce inconsistent results, while Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola (2018) found that the currently popular interpretability frameworks, particularly model-agnostic perturbation-based methods, are often not robust to small changes of the input, which clearly is not acceptable in the health domain. There is a firm recognition of the impact of ML solutions in economics, including health economics, especially in addressing “predictive policy” problems (Athey, 2019). Many authors (e.g., Holzinger et al., 2017; Dawson et al., 2019; Rudin, 2019) note that in the high-stake areas (e.g., medical field, healthcare) solutions, in which the inner workings are not transparent (Weller, 2019), can be unfair, unreliable, inaccurate, and even harmful. Such views are reflected in the legislation on data-driven algorithmic decision-making, which affects citizens across the world. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU, 2016), which entered into force in May 2018, is an example of such early legislation. In the context of the emerging algorithmic economy, there are also warnings to policymakers to be aware of the potential impact of legislations like GDPR on the development of new AI and ML solutions (Wallace and Castro, 2018). These developments increased the pressure on creation of frameworks and methodologies, which can ensure sufficient interpretability of ML solutions. In healthcare, such pressure is amplified by the nature of the interactive processes, wherein neither humans nor the algorithms operate with unbiased data (Sun et al., 2020). Major technology developers, including Google, IBM, and Microsoft, recommend responsible interpretability practices (see, e.g., Google, 2019), including the development of common design principles for human-interpretable machine learning solutions (Lage et al., 2019). 2.3. Consistent Measurement and Evaluation of Interpretability of ML Solutions While there are a number of suggested approaches to measuring interpretability (Molnar et al., 2019), a consensus on the ways of measuring or evaluating the level of interpretability has not been reached. For example, Gilpin et al. (2019) found that the best type of explanation metrics is not clear. Murdoch et al. (2019) mentioned that, currently, there is confusion about the interpretability notion and a lack of clarity about how the proposed interpretation approaches can be evaluated and compared against each other and how to choose a suitable interpretation method for a given issue and audience. The PDR framework (Murdoch et al., 2019), mentioned earlier, is a step in the direction of developing consistent evaluations. Murdoch et al. (2019) further note that there is limited guidance on how interpretability can actually be used in data science life cycles. 2.4. The Emerging Need for Standard Methodology for Handling Interpretability Having a good methodology is important for the success of a data science project. To our knowledge, there is no formal standard for methodology in the data science projects (see Saltz and Shamshurin, 2016). Through the years, the CRISP- DM methodology (Shearer, 2000) created in the late 1990s has become a de-facto standard, as evidenced from a range of works (see, e.g., Huang et al., 2014; Niño et al., 2015; Fahmy et al., 2017; Pradeep and Kallimani, 2017; Abasova et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2018). An important factor of its success is the fact that it is industry, tool, and application agnostic (Mariscal et al., 2010). However, the research community has emphasized that, since its creation, CRISP-DM had not been updated to reflect the evolution of the data science process needs (Mariscal et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2018). While various extensions and refined versions of the methodology, including IBM’s Analytics Solutions Unified Method for Data Mining (ASUM-DM) and Microsoft’s Team Data Science Process (TDSP), were proposed to compensate the weaknesses of CRISP-DM, at this stage, none of them has become the standard. In the more recent years, variations of CRISP-DM tailored for the healthcare (Catley et al., Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare 2009) and medical domain, such as CRISP-MED-DM (Niaksu, 2015), have been suggested. The majority of organisations that apply a data analysis methodology prefers extensions of CRISP- DM (Schäfer et al., 2018). Such extensions are fragmented and either propose additional elements into the data analysis process, or focus on organisational aspects without the necessary integration of domain-related factors (Plotnikova, 2018). These might be the reasons for the observed decline of its usage as reported in studies by Piatetsky-Shapiro (2014), Bhardwaj et al. (2015), and Saltz and Shamshurin (2016). Finally, while methodologies from related fields, like the agile approach used in software development, are being considered for use in data science projects, there is no clear clarity on whether they are fully suitable for the purpose, as indicated by Larson and Chang (2016); therefore, we did not include them in the current scope. This overall lack of consensus has provided an opportunity to reflect on the philosophy of the CRISP-DM methodology and create a comprehensive data science methodology, through which interpretability is embedded consistently into an ML solution. Such methodology faces a list of requirements: – It has to take into account the different perspectives and aspects of interpretability, including model and process explainability and interpretability; – It has to consider the desiderata of explainable AI (fidelity, understandability, sufficiency, low construction overhead, and efficiency) as summarized in Hansen and Rieger (2019); – It needs to support consistent interaction of local and global interpretability of ML solutions with other established key factors in data science projects, including predictive accuracy, bias, noise, sensitivity, faithfulness, and domain specifics; In addition, healthcare researchers have indicated that the choice of interpretable models depends on the use case (Ahmad et al., 2018). In order to standardize the expectations for interpretability, some of these requirements have been addressed in the recently proposed CRISP-ML methodology (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019). In section 3, we will briefly discuss the major concepts differentiating CRISP-ML methodology. The CRISP- ML approach includes the concepts of necessary level of interpretability (NLI) and interpretability matrix (IM), described in detail by Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019), and therefore aligns well with the view of health researchers that the choice of interpretable models depends upon the application and use case for which explanations are required (Ahmad et al., 2018). To illustrate that, in section 4, we present a use case in the public health field that illustrates the typical challenges met and the ways CRISP-ML helped to address and resolve them. 3. CRISP-ML METHODOLOGY—TOWARD INTERPRETABILITY-CENTRIC CREATION OF ML SOLUTIONS The CRISP-ML methodology (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019) of building interpretability of an ML solution is based on revision and update of CRISP-DM to address the opportunities discussed in section 2. It follows the CRISP-DM approach in terms of being industry-, tool-, and application-neutral. CRISP-ML accommodates the necessary elements to work with diverse ML techniques and create the right level of interpretability through the whole ML solution creation process. Its seven stages are described in Figure 1), which is an updated version of the CRISP- ML methodology diagram in the study by Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019). Central to CRISP-ML is the concept of necessary level of interpretability of an ML solution. From this view point, CRISP- ML can be differentiated as a methodology of establishing and building the necessary level of interpretability of a business ML solution. In line with Google’s guidelines on the responsible AI practices in the interpretability area (Google, 2019) and expanding on the approach proposed by Gleicher (2016), we have specified the concept of minimal necessary level of interpretability of a business ML solution as the combination of the degree of accuracy of the underlying algorithm and the extent of understanding the inputs, inner workings, the outputs, the user interface, and the deployment aspects of the solution, which is required to achieve the project goals. If this level is not achieved, the solution will be inadequate for the purpose. This level needs to be established and documented at the initiation stage of the project as part of requirement collection (see Stage 1 in Figure 1). We then describe an ML solution as sufficiently interpretable or not based on whether or not it achieved the required level of interpretability. Obviously, this level will differ from one project to another depending on the business goals. If individuals are directly and strongly affected by the solution-driven decision, e.g., in medical diagnostics or legal settings, then both the ability to understand and trust the internal logic of the model, as well as the ability of the solution to explain individual predictions, are of highest priority. In other cases, when an ML solution is used in order to inform business decisions about policy, strategy, or interventions aimed to improve the business outcome of interest, then it is necessary to understand and trust the internal logic of the model that is of most value, while individual predictions are not the focus of the stakeholders. For example, in one of our projects, an Australian state organization wished to establish what factors influenced the proportion of children with developmental issues and what interventions can be undertaken in specific areas of the state in order to reduce that proportion. The historical, socioeconomic, and geographic data provided for the project was aggregated at a geographic level of high granularity. In other cases, e.g., in the case of an online purchase recommender solution, the overall outcome, such as increase in sales volume, may be of higher importance than interpretability of the model. Similar requirements of solution interpretability were in a project where an organization owned assets that were located in remote areas and were often damaged by birds or animals nests. The organization wished to lower their maintenance cost and planning by identifying as soon as possible the assets where such nests were present instead of doing expensive examination of each asset. This was achieved by building a ML solution that classified Google Earth images of the assets into those with and without nests. In this project, it was Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare FIGURE 1 | Conceptual framework of CRISP-ML methodology. important to identify a proportion of assets that were as high as possible with nests on them, while misclassifying an individual asset image was not of great concern. The recently published CRISP-ML(Q) (Studer et al., 2020) proposes an incremental extension of CRISP-DM with the monitoring and maintenance phases. While the study mentions “model explainability” referring to the technical aspects of the underlying model, it does not consider interpretability and explainability in a systematic way as CRISP-ML (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019). Interpretability is now one of the most important and quickly developing universal requirements, not only a “best practice” requirement in some industries. It is also a legal requirement. CRISP-ML (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019) ensures that the necessary interpretability level is identified at the requirement collection stage. The methodology then ensures that participants establish the activities for each stakeholder group at each process stage that are required to achieve this level. CRISP-ML (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019) includes stages 3 and 4 (data predictive potential assessment and data enrichment in Figure 1), which are not present in CRISP-ML(Q) (Studer et al., 2020). As indicated in Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019), skipping these important phases can result in potential scope creep and even business project failure. In Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019), the individual stages of the CRISP-MLmethodology were presented in detail. Each stage was illustrated with examples from cases from a diverse range of domains. There, the emphasis was on the versatility of CRISP- ML as a industry-neutral methodology, including its approach to interpretability. In this study, we focus on a single case study from health-related domain in order to present a comprehensive coverage of each stage and the connections between the stages, and provide examples of how the required level of interpretability of the solution is achieved through carefully crafted involvement of the stakeholders as well as decisions made at each stage. This study does not provide comparative evaluation of CRISP-ML methodology in comparison to CRISP- DM (Shearer, 2000), ASUM-DM (IBM Analytics, 2015), TDSP (Microsoft, 2020), and other methodologies discussed by Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019). The purpose of the study is to demonstrate, in a robust way, the mechanics of explicit management of interpretability in ML through the project structure and life cycle of a data science methodology. Broader comparative evaluation of the methodology is the subject of a separate study. The structure of the CRISP-ML process methodology has embedded flexibility in it, indicated by the cycles, which link the model-centric stages back to the early data-centric stages, as shown in Figure 1. Changes inevitably occur in any project over the course of the project life cycle, and CRISP-ML reflects that. Themost typical changes, related to data availability, quality, and analysis findings, occur mostly at stages 2–4, as shown in Figure 1. This is illustrated in our case study and was discussed in detail in the study by Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019). Less often changes occur at stages 5–7 in Figure 1. From experiential observations, such changes are more likely to occur in longer projects with a volume of work requiring more than 6–8 months for completion. They are usually driven by amendments in project scope and requirements including the necessary level of interpretability (NLI), that are caused by factors external to the analytical part of the project. These factors can be global, such Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare as environmental, political, or legislative factors; organization- specific (e.g., updates in the organizational IT structure, the way of data storage or changes in the stakeholder team), or they could be related to the progress in ML and ML-related technical areas (e.g., the advent of a new, better performing predictive algorithm). In this study, we present the stages of CRISP-ML in a rigid manner, around the backbone of the CRISP-ML process, represented by the solid black triangle arrows in Figure 1 to maintain the emphasis on the mechanisms for handling interpretability in each of these steps, rather than exploring the iterative nature of the approach. For consistency of the demonstration, we draw all detailed examples through the study from the specific public health case study. As a result, we are able to illustrate in more depth how we sustain the level of interpretability through the process structure of the project. The study complements the study by Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019), where, through the examples drawn from a variety of cases, we demonstrated the versatility of CRISP-ML. The methodological treatment of interpretability in evolving scenarios and options is beyond the scope of this study. 4. CASE STUDY ILLUSTRATING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NLI OF MACHINE LEARNING SOLUTION In this study, we will describe a detailed real-world case study in which, by going through each project stage, we illustrate how CRISP-ML facilitates data science project stakeholders in establishing and achieving the necessary level of interpretability of ML solution. We would like to emphasize that the specific analytic techniques and tools mentioned in the respective stages of the case study are relevant specifically to this particular study. They illustrate the approach and the content of the interpretability mechanisms of CRISP-ML. However, there are many other available methods andmethod combinations that can achieve the objectives of this and other projects. We place a particular focus on the aspects and stages of CRISP-ML from the perspective of demonstrating the flow and impact of interpretability requirements and on how they have been translated into the necessary level of interpretability of the finalML solution. Further, the structure of this section follows the stages of CRISP-ML process structure in Figure 1. All sensitive data and information have been masked and altered to protect privacy and confidentiality, without loss of the sensible aspects relevant to this presentation. 4.1. Background. High-Level Project Objectives and Data Description An Australian State Workers Compensation organization sought to predict, at an early stage of a claim, the likelihood of the claim becoming long-term, i.e., a worker staying on income support for 1 year ormore from the date of lodgement. A further requirement was that the prediction model should be easily interpretable by the business. The data that the analysis was to be based upon were identified by the organizational experts, based on the outcomes for about 20,000 claims incurred in the recent years, and included the following information: – injured worker attributes, e.g., date of birth, gender, occupation, average weekly earnings, residential address; – injury attributes, e.g., injury date, the information on the nature, location, mechanism, and agency of injury coded according to the National Type of Occurrence Classification System2; – employer attributes (size, industry classification); – details of all worker’s income support or similar payments. 4.2. Building the Project Interpretability Matrix: An Overall Approach Interpretability matrix is usually built at Stage 1 of the project as part of the requirement collection process. Data science practitioners recognize Stage 1 as crucial for the overall project success (see, e.g., PMI, 2017), as well as from the solution interpretability building perspective (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019). The IM as a structure for capturing and translating interpretability requirements into specific actions and activities is generalized. However, the specific content of its cells depends on the project. Kolyshkina and Simoff (2019) demonstrated the CRISP-ML stages consistently applied to different projects across a number of industries, data sets, and data types. It covers the activities needed to start up the data science project: (a) the identification of key stakeholders; (b) documenting project objectives and scope; (c) collecting requirements; (d) agreeing upon initial data; (e) preparing a detailed scope statement; and (f) developing project schedule and plan. The deliverable of this stage was a project charter documenting the above activities. 4.2.1. Interpretability-Related Aspects of the Project Charter: Business Objectives, Main Stakeholders, and Interpretability Level We will describe in more detail the aspects of the project charter that were directly related to this study, specifically the established business objectives, main stakeholders, and the established necessary interpretability requirements. 4.2.1.1. Business objectives and main stakeholders. The established objectives included: 1. Build an ML system that will explain what factors and to what extent influence the outcome, i.e., claim duration; 2. Allow the organization to derive business insights that will help make data-driven accurate decisions regarding what changes can be done to improve the outcome, i.e., reduce the likelihood of a long claim by a specified percentage; 2Type of Occurrence Classification System (3rd Edition, Revision 1), Australian Government—Australian Safety and Compensation Council, Canberra, 2008, https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/type-occurrence-classification- system-toocs-3rd-edition-may-2008). Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare 3. Be accurate, robust, and work with real-world organizational data; 4. Have easy-to-understand outputs that would make sense to the executive team and end users (case managers) and that the end users could trust; 5. Present the output as business rules that are easy to understand for end users and to deploy, monitor, and update in organizational data. 6. Ensure that the overall ML solution is easy to understand and implement by the Information Technology (IT) team of the organization and to monitor/update the Business Intelligence (BI) team of the organization. The main stakeholders were identified as follows: Executive team (E); End Users/Domain Experts, i.e., Case management team (DE); Information Technology team who would implement the solution in the organizational data (IT); Business Intelligence team who would monitor the solution performance and update the underlying model (BI); and Modeling team (M). These abbreviations are used further in the descriptions of the stages of the IM. 4.2.1.2. The established necessary interpretability level. The necessary interpretability level (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019) was established as follows. – The E, IT, and DE teams needed to have a clear understanding of all internal and external data inputs to be used: their reliability, quality, and whether the internal inputs were representative of the organizational data that the solution would be deployed on. – The E and DE teams needed to have a clear understanding of the high-level data processing approach (e.g., missing values treatment, aggregation level), as well as high-level modeling approach and its proven validity. – The outputs needed to be provided in the form of easily understandable business rules. The E and DE teams needed to gain a clear understanding of the rules and to be able to assess their business validity and usefulness from the business point of view. – The BI team, who would monitor the solution performance and update it as required, need to have a clear understanding of: – the data processing stage, as well as the modeling algorithm, its validity, and suitability from the ML point of view; – how to assess the solution performance and how the solution needs to be audited, monitored, and updated, as well as how often this should occur. – The IT team, who would deploy the solution needed to have a clear understanding of the format of the output and confirm that it can be deployed in the organizational data within the existing constraints (e.g., resources, cost) and without disrupting the existing IT systems. 4.2.2. Creating the Project IM: An Overall Approach The next step is to create and fill out the IM, whose rows show CRISP-ML stages, and columns represent key stakeholders. In each cell of the matrix, we showed what needs to be done by each stakeholder at each project stage to ensure that the required level of solution interpretability is achieved. Matrix cells can be grouped horizontally when there are common requirements for a group of stakeholders. Matrix cells can be grouped vertically when there are common requirements for a specific stakeholder across a number of stages in CRISP-ML. This matrix, once completed, becomes part of the business requirements document. The activities it outlines are integrated into the project plan and are reviewed and updated along with the project plan. 4.2.2.1.Definition of stakeholder involvement extent. We define the extent of involvement of a stakeholder group needed to achieve the necessary interpretability level in a particular project stage as follows: – high extent of involvement—the stakeholder group needs to be directly and actively involved in the solution development process to ensure that the NLI is achieved at the stage; – medium extent of involvement—the stakeholder group needs to receive detailed regular updates on the progress of the stage and get directly involved in the work from time to time to ensure that the NLI is achieved at the stage. For example, this can refer to DE and IT providing information helping to better understand data sources and business processes of the organization. – low extent of involvement—the stakeholder group is kept informed on the general progress of the stage. In Figure 2, green color background indicates high extent of involvement of a stakeholder group, yellow color shows medium extent of involvement, and the cells with no color in the background show low level of involvement. Depending on the project, the coloring of the cells of the IM will vary. For example, if it had not been necessary to provide knowledge transfer (“Ongoing knowledge and skill development”) to the BI team, then their involvement in Stage 2–5 would have been low and the respective cells would have been left with no color in the background. 4.2.2.2.High-level IM diagram. Figure 2 shows a high-level interpretability matrix for the project. 4.3. Entries to the Project Interpretability Matrix at Each Stage of CRISP-ML Further, we discuss entries to the project IM at each stage of CRISP-ML. 4.3.1. Stage 1 The content of the interpretability matrix related to the project initiation and planning stage (i.e., the first row of the matrix) has been discussed in detail above and is summarized in Figure 3. 4.3.2. Stages 2–4 Stages 2–4 in Figure 1 are mainly data-related and form the data comprehension, cleansing, and enhancement mega-stage. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare FIGURE 2 | High-level interpretability matrix for the project. Further, we consider the content of the interpretability matrix for each of these stages, they are represented by the second, third, and fourth rows of interpretability matrix. 4.3.2.1. Stage 2. Data audit, exploration, and cleansing played a key role in achieving the interpretability level needed for the project. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare Figure 4 demonstrates the content of the interpretability matrix at this stage. This stage established that the data contained characteristics that significantly complicated the modeling, such as a large degree of random variation, multicollinearity, and a highly categorical nature of many potentially important predictors. These findings helped guide the selection of the modeling and data pre-processing approach. Random variation. During workshops with E, DE, and other industry experts, it became clear that there were certain “truths” that pervaded the industry, and we used these to engage with subject matter experts (SME) and promote the value of our modeling project. One such “truth” was that claim duration was influenced principally by nature and location of injury, but in combination with the age of the injured worker, and specifically, older workers tended to have longer duration claims. Our analysis demonstrated the enormous amount of random variation that existed in the data. For example, age, body location, and injury type only explained 3–7% of variation in claim duration. There was agreement among the experts that the FIGURE 3 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 1. FIGURE 4 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 2. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare industry “truths” were insufficient to accurately triage claims and that different approaches were needed. Our exploratory analysis revealed strong random variation in the data, confirming the prevalent view among the workers’ compensation experts that it is the intangible factors, like the injured worker’s mindset and relationship with the employer, that play the key role in the speed of recovery and returning to work. The challenge for the modeling, therefore, was to uncover the predictors that represent these intangibles. Sparseness. Most of the available variables were categorical with large numbers of categories. For example, the variable “Injury Nature” has 143 categories and “Body Location of Injury” has 76 categories. Further, some categories had relatively few observations which made any analysis involving them potentially unreliable and not statistically valid. Such sparseness presented another data challenge. Multicollinearity. There was a high degree of multicollinearity between numerical variables in the data. Data pre-processing. First, we reduced the sparseness among categories by combining some categorical levels in consultation with SMEs to ensure that the changes made business sense. Second, we used a combination of correlation analysis, as well as advanced clustering and feature selection approaches, e.g., Random Forests (see, e.g., Shi and Horvath, 2006) and PCAMIX method using iterative relocation algorithm and ascendant hierarchical clustering (Chavent et al., 2012) to reduce multicollinearity and exclude any redundant variables. 4.3.2.2. Stage 3. Figure 5 shows the content of the interpretability matrix related to the evaluation of the predictive potential of the data (i.e., the third row of the matrix). This stage is often either omitted or not stated explicitly in other processes/frameworks (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019); however, it is crucial for the project success because it establishes whether the information in the data is sufficient for achieving the project goals. To efficiently evaluate what accuracy could be achieved with the initially supplied data, we employed the following different data science methods that have proven their excellence at extracting maximum predictive power from the data: Deep Neural Nets, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Elastic Net. The results were consistent for all the methods used and showed that only a small proportion of the variability of claim duration was explained by the information available in the data. Therefore, the predictive potential of the initially supplied data, containing claim and worker’s data history, indicated that the data set is insufficient for the project objectives. Data enrichment was required. These findings were discussed with DE who then were invited to share their business knowledge about sources that could enrich the initial data predictive power. 4.3.2.3. Stage 4. Data enrichment. Figure 6 shows the content of the interpretability matrix related to the data enrichment stage. Based on the DE feedback and results of external research, we enriched the data with additional variables, including: – lag between injury occurrence and claim lodgement (claim reporting lag); – information on the treatment received (e.g., type of providers visited, number of visits, provider specialty); – information on the use of medications and, specifically, on whether a potent opioid was used. We assessed the predictive value of the enriched data in the same way as before (see section 4.3.2.2), and found that there was a significant increase in the proportion of variability explained by the model. Of particular relevance was the incorporation of the prior claim history of claimants, including previous claim count, type and nature of injury, and any similarity with the current injury. Further, the data enrichment was a key step in building further trust of the DE team. The fact that the model showed that the FIGURE 5 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 3. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare cost of a claim can be significantly dependent on the providers a worker visited built further trust in the solution, because it confirmed the hunch of domain experts that they previously had not had enough evidence to prove. 4.3.3. Stage 5 Figure 7 shows the content of the interpretability matrix for the model building and evaluation stage. To achieve the right interpretability level, it is crucial that modelers choose the right technique that will balance the required outcome interpretability with the required level of accuracy of the model, which is often a challenge (see, e.g., Freitas, 2014), as well as with other requirements/constraints (e.g., the needed functional form of the algorithm). In our case, it was required that the model explained at least 70% of variability. At this stage, the ML techniques to be used for modeling are selected, taking into account the predictive power of the model, its suitability for the domain and the task, and the NLI. The data is pre-processed, and modeled, and the model performance is evaluated. The solution output was required to be produced in the form of business rules, and therefore, the feature engineering methods and modeling algorithms used included rule-based techniques, e.g., decision trees, and association rules- based methods. 4.3.4. Stage 6 Figure 8 shows how the interpretability matrix reflects the role of interpretability in the formulation of business insights necessary to achieve the project goals and in helping the E and DE to understand the derived business insights and to develop trust in FIGURE 6 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 4. FIGURE 7 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 5. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 12 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare them. Modelers, BI and DEs, prepared a detailed presentation for the E, explaining not only the learnings from the solution but also the high-level model structure and its accuracy. 4.3.5. Stage 7 The final model provided the mechanism for the organization to allocate claims to risk segments based on the information known at early stages. From the technical point of view, the business rules were confirmed by the E, DE, and IT to be easy to deploy as they are readily expressed as SQL code. Based on this success, a modified version of claims triage was deployed into production. Figure 9 shows the shift of responsibilities for ensuring the achieved interpretability level is maintained during the future use of the solution. At this stage, the deployment was being scheduled, and the monitoring/updating process and schedule was prepared, based on the technical report provided by the M team that included project code, the solution manual, and updating and monitoring recommendations. 5. CONCLUSIONS This study contributes toward addressing the problem for providing organizations with capabilities to ensure that the ML solutions they develop to improve decision-making are transparent and easy to understand and interpret. If needed, the logic behind the decisions can be explained to any external party. Such capability is essential in many areas, especially in health- related fields. It allows the end users to confidently interpret the ML output use to make successful evidence-based decisions. In an earlier study (Kolyshkina and Simoff, 2019), we introduced CRISP-ML, a methodology of determining FIGURE 8 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 6. FIGURE 9 | Interpretability matrix content for Stage 7 includes activities ensuring the achieved interpretability level is maintained during the future utilization of the solution. Frontiers in Big Data | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2021 | Volume 4 | Article 660206 Kolyshkina and Simoff Interpretability of Machine Learning in Public Healthcare the interpretability level required for the successful real- world solution and then achieving it via integration of the interpretability aspects into its overall framework instead of just the algorithm creation stage. CRISP-ML combines practical, common-sense approach with statistical rigor and enables organizations to establish shared understanding across all key stakeholders about the solution and its use and build trust in the solution outputs across all relevant parts of the organization. In this study, we illustrated CRISP-ML with a detailed case study of building an ML solution in the Public Health sector. An Australian state workplace insurer sought to use their data to establish clear business rules that would identify, at an earlier stage of a claim, those with high probability of becoming serious/long-term. We showed how the necessary level of solution interpretability was determined and achieved. First, we showed how it was established by working with the key stakeholders (Executive team, end users, IT team, etc.). Then, we described how the activities that were required to be included at each stage of building the ML solution to ensure that this level is achieved was determined. Finally, we described how these activities were integrated into each stage. The study demonstrated how CRISP-ML addressed the problemswith data diversity, unstructured nature of the data, and relatively low linkage between diverse data sets in the healthcare domain (Catley et al., 2009; Niaksu, 2015). The characteristics of the case study which we used are typical for healthcare data, and CRISP-ML managed to deliver on these issues, ensuring the required interpretability of the ML solutions in the project. While we have not completed formal evaluation of CRISP- ML, there are two aspects which indicate that the use of this methodology improves the chances of success of data science projects. On the one hand, CRISP-ML is built on the strengths of CRISP-DM, which made it the preferred and effective methodology (Piatetsky-Shapiro, 2014; Saltz et al., 2017), addressing its identified limitations in previous works (e.g., Mariscal et al., 2010). On the other hand, CRISP-ML has been successfully deployed in a number of recent real-world projects across several industries and fields, including credit risk, insurance, utilities, and sport. It ensured on meeting the interpretability requirements of the organizations, regardless of industry specifics, regulatory requirements, types of stakeholders involved, project objectives, and data characteristics, such as type (structured as well as unstructured), size, or complexity level. CRISP-ML is a living organism and, as such, it responds to the rapid progress in the development of ML algorithms and the evolution of the legislation for their adoption. Consequently, CRISP-ML development includes three directions: (i) the development of a richer set of quantitative measures of interpretability features for human interpretable machine learning, (ii) the development of the methodology and respective protocols for machine interpretation, and (iii) the development of formal process support. The first one is being extended in a way to provide input to the development and evaluation of common design principles for human interpretable ML solutions in line with that described in the study by Lage et al. (2019). This strategic development adds the necessary agility for the relevance of the presented cross-industry standard process.

INTRODUCTION In the medical field, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in developing algorithms and techniques to aid in disease diagnosis. Medical diagnosis entails determining the illness or conditions that account for an individual's symptoms and indicators, usually relying on their medical background and physical assessment. However, this process can be challenging as many symptoms are ambiguous and require expertise from trained health professionals. This becomes particularly problematic in countries like Bangladesh and India, where there is a scarcity of healthcare professionals, making it difficult to provide proper diagnostic procedures for a large population of patients. Additionally, medical tests required for diagnosis can be expensive and unaffordable for low-income individuals [1-3]. Due to human error, over diagnosis can occur, leading to unnecessary treatment and negatively impacting both the patient's health and the economy. Reports suggest that a significant number of people experience at least one diagnostic mistake during their lifetime. Several factors contribute to misdiagnosis, including the lack of noticeable symptoms, the presence of rare diseases, and diseases being mistakenly omitted from consideration [4, 5]. ML has found widespread applications in various fields, from cutting-edge technology to healthcare, including disease diagnosis. Its popularity is growing, and it is becoming increasingly utilized in healthcare to improve diagnostic accuracy and safety. ML serves as a robust mechanism enabling machines to learn autonomously, eliminating the requirement for explicit programming. It harnesses sophisticated algorithms and statistical methods to analyze data and formulate predictions, departing from traditional rule-based systems. The accuracy of machine learning predictions heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the dataset used. Its applications span various industries, including finance, retail, and healthcare [6, 7], where it presents significant opportunities for disease diagnosis and treatment. One of the notable features of machine learning is its continuous improvement in data prediction and classification. As more data is gathered, the prediction models become more adept at making accurate decisions. In the healthcare sector, patient datasets stored in electronic healthcare records can be leveraged to extract relevant information using ML techniques [8, 9, 10]. These algorithms aid in disease diagnosis by analyzing data and predicting the underlying causes of illnesses based on disease-causing variables extracted from electronic health records [11]. Compared to traditional bio statistical approaches, machine learning has gained popularity for tasks like classification, prediction, and clustering involving complex healthcare data. It has demonstrated exceptional results in various medical tasks, such as identifying body organs from medical images [12], classifying interstitial lung diseases [13], reconstructing medical images [14, 15], and segmenting brain tumors [15]. Overall, the use of ML in healthcare has shown great promise in advancing disease analysis, diagnosis, and treatment, showcasing its potential to transform the field by leveraging vast amounts of data for accurate and efficient healthcare solutions [16-21]. International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 – 8887) Volume 185 – No. 36, October 2023 11 2. AI IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE The utilization of AI and the related technologies is becoming more widespread in both the business sector and society. This trend is now extending to the healthcare domain. The aforementioned technologies has the capacity to revolutionize various facets of patient care, as well as administrative procedures within provider, payer, and pharmaceutical entities. Machine learning is a statistical methodology utilized to effectively fit models to data and acquire knowledge through the process of training models with data. Machine learning is widely recognized as a prevalent manifestation of artificial intelligence. In the field of healthcare, precision medicine is a widely employed application of traditional machine learning. It involves the prediction of treatment outcomes for patients by considering a range of patient features and the contextual factors around the therapy. Supervised learning is a fundamental requirement for the bulk of machine learning and precision medicine applications, wherein a training dataset is necessary to possess known outcome variables, such as the beginning of disease. The neural network, a sophisticated variant of machine learning, has been a prominent technology in healthcare research for several decades. Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s. Neural networks have been effectively employed in categorization tasks, such as predicting the likelihood of a patient developing a specific disease. The framework adopts a perspective that analyses problems by considering the inputs, outputs, and weights of variables, sometimes referred to as ""features,"" which establish the associations between inputs and outcomes. The most intricate manifestations of machine learning encompass deep learning, which pertains to neural network models characterized by numerous tiers of features or variables that facilitate the prediction of events. The quicker processing capabilities of contemporary graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures have enabled the discovery of several latent features inside these models, perhaps amounting to thousands. One prevalent utilization of deep learning in the healthcare field involves the identification and classification of possibly malignant lesions in radiographic images. The utilization of deep learning techniques is becoming more prevalent in the field of radiomics, which involves the identification of diagnostically significant characteristics in imaging data that beyond the capabilities of human visual perception [22]. Radiomics and deep learning are frequently utilized in the domain of oncology-focused image analysis. The amalgamation of these technologies exhibits potential for enhanced diagnostic precision compared to the preceding iteration of automated image analysis tools, commonly referred to as computer-aided detection (CAD) [23, 24]. Over the years, intelligent healthcare systems have commonly relied on centralized artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities situated in either the cloud or the data center to facilitate the learning and analysis of health data. The current centered solution in modern healthcare networks is inefficient in terms of communication latency and lacks high network scalability due to the growing volumes of health data and the proliferation of IoMT driven devices. Moreover, the dependence on a centralized server or third-party entity for data learning gives rise to significant privacy concerns, such as the potential leakage of user information and the risk of data breaches. This assertion holds special validity within the realm of e-healthcare, as health-related data is characterized by its high sensitivity and privacy, hence necessitating adherence to health standards. Furthermore, it is anticipated that in forthcoming healthcare systems, a centralized AI architecture may become less appropriate due to the decentralized nature of health data, which is dispersed across a vast IoMT network. Hence, it is imperative to adopt distributed artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies in order to facilitate the development of scalable and privacy-conscious intelligent healthcare applications at the network edge. In the present scenario, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a viable method for achieving cost-effective smart healthcare applications while enhancing privacy protection [25, 26]. From a conceptual standpoint, FL is an AI methodology that facilitates the development of AI models of superior quality. This is achieved by combining and averaging local updates obtained from numerous health data clients, such as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices [27, 28]. Notably, Florida accomplishes this without necessitating direct access to the individual data stored locally. This measure has the potential to hinder the disclosure of sensitive user information and user preferences, thereby reducing the dangers associated with privacy leakage. In addition, the utilization of FL in the healthcare domain allows for the aggregation of substantial computational and dataset resources from various health data clients, thereby enhancing the quality of AI model training, particularly in terms of accuracy. This improvement may not be attainable through the implementation of centralized AI approaches that rely on smaller datasets and have limited computational capabilities [29, 30]. 3. ML FOR DIFFERENT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS In recent years, the proliferation of accessible hardware and cloud computing resources has ushered in a significant increase in the application of Machine Learning (ML) across various facets of human life. This span encompasses domains as diverse as leveraging ML for personalized social media recommendations to its adoption for streamlining industrial processes through automation. Among these evolving domains, the healthcare sector stands out as an industry progressively adapting to the potential of ML. The implementation of ML algorithms within healthcare holds tremendous promise due to the substantial data volume amassed for each individual patient. This reservoir of data empowers ML algorithms to proactively chart comprehensive treatment plans for patients, contributing to cost reduction and an enhanced overall patient experience. This phenomenon is particularly advantageous, positioning ML as a latent advantage within the healthcare industry. The sector grapples with an abundance of unstructured data, including patient records, historical treatment methods, and familial medical histories. By analyzing these data repositories, ML algorithms bolster healthcare professionals in predicting forthcoming health issues, thus effectively capitalizing on patients' historical data. The rapid progression of ML technology has catalyzed the paradigm shift towards information-centric healthcare administration and delivery. Contemporary healthcare enhancement strategies, characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, in conjunction with refined imaging and genetics-informed personalized therapeutic models, hinge on the underpinning of ML-powered information systems. As such, Machine Learning is substantiating its role as an indispensable asset poised to drive significant advancements within the healthcare domain. Various ML approaches have gained significant attention from both academics and practitioners in disease diagnosis. This section provides an overview of focusing on the application of ML models in diagnosing various types of diseases. Notably, the global relevance of COVID-19 has led to numerous studies International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 – 8887) Volume 185 – No. 36, October 2023 12 focusing on its detection using ML since 2020, which also received priority in our investigation. We briefly discuss severe diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, breast cancer, and Dementia. 3.1 Dementia Classification Alzheimer's Disease (AD) constitutes the most prevalent form of dementia necessitating extensive medical attention. AD is a chronic brain disorder with neurobiological origins that gradually leads to the demise of brain cells. This progression results in impairments to memory and cognitive abilities, eventually leading to an inability to perform basic tasks. Dementia linked to Alzheimer's manifests in various stages: (a) Mild Cognitive Impairment: Often marked by memory lapses as individuals age, it can also evolve into dementia for some. (b) Mild Dementia: Individuals with mild dementia experience cognitive difficulties that impact their daily routines. Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, personality changes, disorientation, and struggles with routine tasks. (c) Moderate Dementia: This stage involves increased complexity in daily life, requiring additional care and support. Symptoms mirror mild dementia but are more pronounced. Patients may exhibit personality shifts, paranoia, and sleep disturbances. (d) Severe Dementia: Symptoms worsen in this phase, with communication impairments and a need for constant care. Basic functions like bladder control and maintaining head position become challenging. Even simple actions, such as sitting in a chair, become unmanageable. Table 1: ML in Dementia Diagnosis Ref. Dataset Model Accuracy (%) Specificity (%) Recall (%) [31] OASIS (373 samples, 10 variables) XGB 85.61 81.40 77.20 [32] 169 Samples, 14 variables RF 92 88 88 [33] OASIS RF 89.29 - 89 XGB 89.39 - 89 GB 91.02 - 91 Voting 1 (Soft) 91.17 - 91 Efforts are underway to detect AD early, aiming to slow the abnormal brain degeneration, lower healthcare costs, and enhance treatment outcomes. The utilization of ML techniques has demonstrated considerable promise in the categorization of dementia, a multifaceted neurological condition that impacts cognitive abilities. By utilizing sophisticated algorithms and computational methodologies, ML models possess the capacity to examine a wide range of data sources and assist in the timely identification, prediction, and tailored therapeutic strategies for individuals affected by dementia. Several researchers already deployed various ML models to classify dementia patient. Table 1 summarizes some ML models deployed in dementia diagnosis. 3.2 Heart Disease Detection Machine learning (ML) approaches have been extensively used by researchers and practitioners to identify cardiac disease [33, 34]. For instance, a neurofuzzy-integrated system was developed in [33] for detecting heart disease that achieved accuracy of approximately 89%. Yet, the study's primary limitation is the absence of a well-defined clarification regarding the performance of their suggested technique across diverse scenarios like multiclass classification, extensive data analysis, and addressing imbalanced class distribution. Furthermore, there's a notable omission of dialogue regarding the model's trustworthiness and interpretability, a factor progressively vital in medical domains to enhance comprehensibility for non-medical individuals. In [35], researchers introduced a deep CNN to detect irregular cardiac sounds. They optimized the loss function to enhance sensitivity and specificity on the training dataset. This model underwent testing in the 2016 Physio Net computing competition, yielding a final prediction specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 73% [35]. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) algorithms have garnered attention in cardiac disease detection. In [36], a DL-based technique was developed for diagnosing cardiotocographic fetal health based on multiclass morphologic patterns. This model aimed to categorize patterns in individuals with pregnancy complications. Initial computational results displayed an accuracy of 88.02%, precision of 85.01%, and F-score of 85% [36]. Overfitting was addressed using various dropout strategies, leading to an increased training time, which they noted as a trade-off for achieving heightened accuracy. Liu et al. (2012) employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) to create predictive systems for cardiac arrest within 72 hours [37]. In a Cleveland dataset study, Shah et al. (2020) compared SVM, Random Forest (RF), Ordinal Regression, Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB) for heart disease detection, with SVM yielding 95% accuracy [38]. Besides SVM and CNN, other algorithms like ensemble learning [39], k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) [40], Decision Trees (DT) [41], Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [42], and Bayesian Networks (BN) [43] were also employed in heart disease prediction. However, recent studies highlight Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) superiority for both balanced and imbalanced datasets. Researchers have introduced GAN-based models [44, 45, 46]. Wang et al. (2021) introduced CAB, a GAN-based approach addressing imbalance-related issues, achieving 99.71% accuracy in arrhythmia patients [44]. Rath et al. (2021) combined Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with GAN, accurately detecting heart disease patients from the MIT-BIH dataset with up to 99.4% accuracy [47]. These recent developments in GAN-based approaches showcase their potential in improving the accuracy and performance of machine learning models for cardiac disease diagnosis. The integration of GANs with other machine learning techniques holds promise for addressing imbalance-related challenges and achieving high accuracy in predicting heart diseases. Further research in this area is expected to enhance the capabilities of ML models to detect heart disease and contribute to more effective healthcare diagnostics. Despite the wide adoption of ML applications in heart disease diagnosis, there is a lack of research addressing the challenges related to unbalanced data in multiclass classification. Additionally, most models lack sufficient explain ability during the final prediction, which hampers their understanding and trustworthiness. Further research is needed to address these issues and improve the transparency and robustness of ML-based cardiac disease detection systems. 3.3 Kidney Disease Detection Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) refers to a condition wherein the kidneys experience damage, leading to an impaired blood filtration process. The kidneys' primary function involves International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 – 8887) Volume 185 – No. 36, October 2023 13 extracting excess water and waste from the blood to generate urine. In cases of CKD, the kidneys fail to effectively eliminate waste, resulting in its accumulation within the body. This ailment earns its ""chronic"" status due to the gradual and extended nature of the damage it inflicts over time. CKD stands as a prevalent global health concern, potentially giving rise to various health complications. The origins of CKD are diverse, encompassing factors like diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and heart disease. Firstly, in [48], the authors conducted their research on clinical and blood biochemical measurements from 551 patients with proteinuria. Several ML models, including RF, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), LR, elastic net (ElasNet), lasso and ridge regression, k-NN, SVM, and artificial neural network (ANN), were compared for CKD risk prediction. The models ElasNet, lasso, ridge, and LR showed superior predictive performance, achieving a mean AUC and precision above 87% and 80%, respectively. LR ranked first, attaining an AUC of 87.3%, with a recall and specificity of 83% and 82%, respectively. ElasNet achieved the highest recall (0.85), while Extra Gradient Boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest specificity (0.83). In a separate investigation [49], researchers employed SVM, AdaBoost, LDA, and gradient boosting (GBoost) algorithms to formulate accurate models for CKD prediction, utilizing a dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The gradient boosting classifier attained the highest accuracy of 99.80%. In [50], authors concentrated on the CKD dataset, employing LR, Decision Tree (DT), and k-NN algorithms to develop three distinct CKD prediction models. LR exhibited the highest accuracy at 97%, outperforming DT (96.25%) and k-NN (71.25%). Similarly, another study [51] evaluated Naïve Bayes (NB), RF, and LR models for CKD risk prediction, achieving respective accuracies of 93.9%, 98.88%, and 94.76% on the dataset. Furthermore, in [52], a system for CKD risk prediction was proposed using data from 455 patients and real-time dataset. RF and ANN were trained and tested with 10-fold cross-validation, achieving accuracies of 97.12% and 94.5%, respectively. ANN and RF was deployed on CKD datasets having data of 455 instances with 25 features in [53]. The most significant features were collected using Chi-Square Test. The accuracy obtained by RF and ANN was 97.12% and 94.5%, respectively. A machine learning-based model was created in [54] with the aim of predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients. The model's performance was evaluated on two sets of data: one containing all attributes and another containing only selected features. Within the realm of feature selection methods, three common approaches are often employed: Wrapper, Filter, and Embedded. These methods serve the purpose of identifying and selecting the most crucial features for a given task or problem. The model was trained using various machine learning classifiers, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), C5.0, Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). Based on the experimental findings, it was observed that the LSVM algorithm attained the maximum level of accuracy, reaching 98.86%, when applied to the SMOTE technique with all features included. SMOTE is widely regarded as an effective method for addressing class imbalance in datasets. The utilization of SMOTE in conjunction with feature selection by LASSO regression yielded superior outcomes compared to the LASSO regression model without the implementation of SMOTE [54]. In their study, Xiao et al. [55] utilized a dataset of 551 patients and implemented nine distinct machine learning algorithms. These algorithms included XGBoost, logistic regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, random forest, ridge regression, neural network, Elastic Net, and KNN. The researchers conducted an evaluation of many performance metrics, including accuracy, ROC curve, precision, and recall. The results indicated that the linear model exhibited the highest level of accuracy. Sujata Drall et al. [56] worked with the UCI-provided CKD dataset containing 400 instances and 25 attributes. First, data was pre-processed, then missing data was identified and replaced with zero, and the dataset was transformed and applied. After pre-processing, the authors employed an algorithm for significant attributes and identified the five most significant features, followed by the classification algorithms Nave Bayes and KNN. The obtained result KNN was the most accurate. Furthermore, a research study [57] employed classifiers such as extra-trees (ET), AdaBoost, KNN, GBoost, XGB, DT, Gaussian Naïve Bayes (NB), and RF. Among them, KNN and Extra Trees classifiers (ET) showed the best performance with accuracies of 99% and 98%, respectively. Highest Precision of 99.11% was achieved using ET and KNN. In addition, ANN-based regression analysis for managing sparse medical datasets was proposed in [58]. To improve upon the pre-existing radial basis function (RBF) input-doubling technique, they incorporated new variables into the output signal calculation algorithm. Similarly, in [59], a new input doubling method based on the classical iterative RBF neural network was designed. The highest accuracy of the proposed method was validated by experimenting with a small medical dataset, using Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error. In [60], an innovative method for data augmentation with enhanced disease categorization was implemented that was based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Experiments were conducted on the NIH chest X-ray image dataset, and the test accuracy of CNN model was 60.3%. However, the online GAN-augmented CNN model showed improved performance, achieving a test accuracy of 65.3%. In [61], a methodology based on supervised learning was presented, focusing on developing efficient models for predicting the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurrence. The study mainly concentrated on probabilistic, tree-based, and ensemble learning-based models. Several algorithms were evaluated, including SVM, Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-NN. 3.4 Breast Cancer Detection Breast cancer is the leading cancer in females worldwide, caused by abnormal growth of cells in the breast. Various techniques, including breast screening or mammography, have been introduced for accurate diagnosis. Mammography uses X-rays to check the nipple status of women, but early detection of small cancer cells remains challenging. Machine learning, deep learning, and bio-inspired computing techniques have been applied in medical prognoses, but none has consistently provided accurate results. Mammography requires doctors to analyze a large volume of imaging data, reducing accuracy and leading to time-consuming procedures with potential for misdiagnosis. As medical research advances, new systems are being developed for improved breast cancer detection. A denotes Accuracy, P denotes Precision, SP denotes Specificity and Se denotes Sensitivity. Table 2 summarizes the performance of some ML models in breast cancer classification.

CHALLENGES & FUTURE DIRECTIONS ML-based applications have been widely employed in illness detection; nevertheless, the implementation of these applications in healthcare as practical tools presents several problems for researchers and practitioners. Even though numerous hospitals and healthcare institutions have collected extensive patient data, the availability of real-world data for worldwide research purposes is limited due to the constraints imposed by data privacy regulations. Often, clinical data is subject to noise or missing values, resulting in a significant time investment required to render such data trainable. The problem of adversarial attack is a significant challenge within the context of illness datasets. The utilization of machine learning models in the development of illness diagnosis models carries the potential for significant harm in the event of misclassification pertaining to a specific disease. For example, the misdiagnosis of a patient with stomach cancer as a non-cancer patient can have significant consequences. One of the primary issues associated with the machine learning (ML) model pertains to its tendency to frequently misidentify a region as diseased, hence leading to erroneous outcomes. The majority of machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), exhibited high levels of performance when trained on labelled data. Nevertheless, the performance of comparable algorithms experienced a notable decrease when exposed to the unlabeled data. However, it should be noted that certain widely-used algorithms, such as K-means clustering, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), may experience a decline in performance when applied to multidimensional data. The issues discussed in the preceding part may provide valuable insights for future scholars and practitioners, guiding their future endeavors. The utilization of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has gained significant prominence within the realm of deep learning. By employing this methodology, it becomes feasible to produce artificial data that has a striking resemblance to authentic data. Hence, the utilization of GANs could potentially serve as a viable solution for addressing challenges related to limited availability of data. The progression of contemporary technology has facilitated the acquisition of data with high resolutions and multiple attributes. Although the conventional ML approach may not yield satisfactory results when applied to high-quality data, employing a mix of many ML models could prove to be a viable solution for effectively managing such data with many dimensions.

CONCLUSION Machine learning has the potential to bring about numerous technological revolutions in the healthcare industry. It has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, facilitate the discovery of trends and patterns in patient data, streamline administrative processes, and make possible patient-specific treatment plans. Both supervised and unsupervised learning have their advantages and disadvantages in the medical field. The task at hand, the amount of data at hand, and the resources at your disposal will all dictate the style of learning you employ. Machine learning will become increasingly important in healthcare as data volumes increase. Further investigation into the constraints discussed in the paper's final two sections would be very welcome. Future MLBDD research could also center on issues such optimizing big data sets that include numerical, categorical, and picture data, as well as multiclass classification with highly imbalanced data and highly missing data, and the explanation and interpretation of multiclass data classification utilizing XAI. 6.

Revised on January 12, 202310.1 IntroductionSmart healthcare refers to the implementation of cutting-edge technologies within the health-care sector, including but not limited to the IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning(ML), deep learning (DL), and data analytics. Population expansion and a rise in the preva-lence of diseases have combined to necessitate the development of a sophisticated healthcaresystem. In recent times, there have been numerous developments in the field of intelligenthealthcare that have been observed globally. These include agile treatment, timely provi-sion of services, remote monitoring of services, and timely response to emergency situations.Nonetheless, this presents the greatest obstacle to satisfying the rising demand for equipmentand smart devices [1]. The resolution of this obstacle was achieved through the implemen-tation of IoT in the healthcare sector. IoT implementation in the medical field has grown inpopularity following advances in technology such as smart cities, smart regions, and smartdevices.The healthcare technology community has shown significant interest and anticipation inthe IoT in recent years. With its practical applications, the healthcare industry stands tobenefit from a wide range of opportunities due to IoT integration. The utilization of millionsof sensors attached to a patient’s body allows for the real-time collection of health data,enabling continuous remote health monitoring. Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSN)represent a key technology for patient monitoring [2]. These sensors gather crucial healthdata such as glucose levels, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and ECG readings [3].More recent systems incorporate actuators that can modify the external environment andenable notification or alarm systems. The application domain of IoT-based smart healthcarehas seen remarkable advancements. This includes areas such as elderly monitoring, diseaseprediction, fitness tracking, remote monitoring, and disease treatment. These are just a fewexamples of the extensive developments in this field [4, 5, 6].Amid the advancements, a substantial amount of data, commonly referred to as big data,is generated by IoT devices. This data requires preprocessing to extract valuable insightsfor subsequent analysis. ML plays a crucial role in this process, particularly in IoT-basedsmart healthcare, where it’s integrated to manage big data analytics [7, 8]. ML techniqueshandle extensive data, learning from it, training systems, facilitating enhanced decision-making, and refining treatment design. These techniques derive meaningful insights, uncoverpatterns, and reveal concealed information within large datasets. The key components ofthis layer encompass clustering, classification, association analysis, time series analysis, andoutlier analysis [7, 9]. The integration of ML with IoT devices simplifies the monitoring,management, and analysis of medical reports. ML algorithms excel at processing extensivebiological data and quickly detecting specific patterns and mutations associated with differentdiseases. This capability can expedite the discovery of new therapeutic solutions.Chapter Motivation: Researchers have extensively investigated smart healthcare com-ponents, methodologies, and technologies over the years, leading to a wealth of comprehensivediscussions on the subject. These studies have proven beneficial to researchers in shapingtheir future contributions. Consequently, the pivotal question arises: what distinguishes thischapter from others, and why should readers dedicate their time to exploring the founda-tional concepts presented herein? To address this inquiry, a comparative analysis is outlined2Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023below:• To the best of our knowledge, there has been a notable absence of dedicated studies,including book chapters, focusing on smart healthcare challenges and future directionsin recent years.• Our investigation involved searches on prominent digital libraries utilizing the (”sur-vey” OR ”review”) on (”smart healthcare” AND (”Challenges” OR ”Future Direc-tions”)) using ((”IoT” OR ”Internet of Things”) AND (”ML” OR ”Machine Learn-ing”)) keywords.

Notably, smart healthcare technologies that donot align with the primary motivation were deliberately excluded from consideration.Table 10.1: Comparison between recent studies and this work (applying of ML into IoT isrepresented as ML and IOT. means yes and means no)Comparison TypeRecent Studies[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Our workBook chapterTechnologiesIoT basedML basedApplicationsML and IoTIoT basedML basedChallengesML and IoTIoT basedML basedFuture WorkDirectionsML and IoTReaders are encouraged to delve into this chapter for a comprehensive and current under-standing of the evolving landscape of smart healthcare.Contributions: This chapter extensively discusses the obstacles that impede the progressof smart healthcare using IoT and ML approaches. The aim is to assist future contributors inunderstanding and addressing these challenges. Specifically, the contributions of this chaptercan be summarized as follows:1. This chapter extensively discusses the existing smart healthcare applications, researchchallenges, and future work directions in three distinct scenarios: IoT-based, ML-based,and employing ML in IoT-based healthcare.2. While exploring existing smart healthcare applications, we not only provided briefdetails on these applications but also delved into a separate discussion on how ML has3Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023transformed this sector. Additionally, we highlighted the synergies between ML andIoT, showcasing how this combination has played a crucial role in enhancing healthcaresystems.3. Existing schemes have been explored in order to understand the challenges faced bycurrent researchers developing ML-driven IoT applications.Chapter Organization: The chapter commences with Section 10.2, which explores thereal-life applications of the three individual domains. This section starts by briefly outliningthe applications of IoT-based healthcare (10.2.1), followed by examples of how ML hastransformed the healthcare domain (10.2.2), and concludes by examining the integration ofML in IoT-based smart healthcare solutions (10.2.3). The subsequent section (10.3) providesan in-depth survey summarizing the challenges encountered in IoT and ML-based smarthealthcare. This section is divided into three subsections, with each subsection individuallyrepresenting the three domain-specific smart healthcare open challenges. Finally, the chapterconcludes by outlining domain-specific potential future directions in Section (10.4), as basedon the survey.10.2 Exploring ML and IoT ApplicationsSmart healthcare is a technologically advanced field that revolutionizes conventional medicaland healthcare systems. Its primary objectives are to enhance healthcare services, improvepatient care, and optimize the entire healthcare ecosystem through the integration of cutting-edge technologies, data-driven insights, and interconnected devices. By doing so, it aims tomake healthcare more efficient, adaptable, and customized. Smart healthcare relies on a va-riety of key components, including IoT devices, wearable and implantable medical devices,AI, electronic health records (EHR), big data analytics, and more. It goes beyond clin-ical transformations, encompassing the collection, secure storage, and efficient processingof diverse physiological data. This comprehensive approach facilitates the early detectionof diseases and even preventive measures against various medical conditions. One notablefeature of smart healthcare is its capacity to facilitate remote patient monitoring throughinternet-connected devices. This capability is especially valuable for individuals with dis-abilities and the elderly. Moreover, it has the potential to significantly reduce healthcarecosts while simultaneously enhancing the quality of life for patients [15]. The integration oftechnology in the healthcare sector, known as smart healthcare, is a notable advancement.This approach utilizes technological capabilities to enhance the quality, accessibility, andpatient-centricity of healthcare services. Consequently, it contributes to the enhancement ofhealth outcomes and the optimization of healthcare delivery efficiency.The services provided by smart healthcare based on the target user can be utilized inseveral categories, including clinical/scientific research institutions (e.g., hospitals), regionalhealth decision-making institutions, or individual/family users/personalized service. Thissection provides a brief overview of several IoT-based smart healthcare applications, followedby a discussion of ML-integrated smart healthcare. It concludes with a demonstration ofapplications showcasing the intersection of IoT and ML in various domains.4Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 202310.2.1 Practical Uses of IoT in Smart HealthcareThe application of IoT-based smart healthcare can be divided into several based on differentneeds [16]. Various characteristics of IoT possess the potential to revolutionize the healthcaredomain to a great extent. This subsection provides a brief overview of some particularlyimportant examples of IoT-based smart healthcare.Remote Monitoring and Disease DetectionIoT provides continuous remote monitoring through wearable devices, which plays a criti-cal role in early disease detection and prevention. Continuous remote monitoring throughwearable devices plays a critical role in early disease detection and prevention.Wu et al. [4] have presented an ECG data monitoring system that involves the attachmentof a bipotential device to the user’s t-shirt, with data transmitted to a smartphone viaBluetooth. This setup empowers healthcare professionals to detect unusual disease signs,enabling timely intervention and treatment for patients. Agustine et al. [18] have introducedan integrated alert system that issues notifications when oxygen levels surpass predefinedthresholds. This alert system can facilitate prompt medical interventions, potentially savinglives.Smart Treatment and Smart Surgical EnvironmentIoT-based methodologies play a crucial role in cancer treatment, as demonstrated by Hesh-mat et al.’s novel technique integrating various stages like chemotherapy and radiotherapy.This system securely stores laboratory test data on a cloud-based server, empowering physi-cians to monitor and regulate prescription dosages. Moreover, it facilitates remote consulta-tions via a dedicated mobile application [6].In surgical training and medical operations, IoT has been instrumental in developing ad-vanced solutions like surgical robotics and virtual reality-based training environments. Anexemplary advancement is a surgical training framework utilizing virtual reality to simu-late authentic training scenarios, enabling global interaction among surgeons for collabora-tive learning and expertise exchange [19]. Notable examples of robotic systems include theDa Vinci system (manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), the Sensei Xrobotic catheter system (Hansen Medical, Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA), andthe Flex® robotic system (Medrobotics, Raynham, MA, USA).Virtual Health Platform and AssistantIntelligent healthcare introduces the concept of a readily accessible mHealth platform formedical professionals, patients, and researchers, facilitating remote patient monitoring andoffering telemedicine services. This platform supports collaborative efforts for disease re-search. Additionally, smart healthcare systems empower patients to self-monitor their phys-ical condition, as exemplified by the Stress Detection and Alleviation system using wearablemedical sensors for continuous stress level tracking and autonomous stress reduction support[22, 23]. IoT-based healthcare systems leverage virtual assistants as intermediaries, aidingpatients in translating everyday language into medical terms and autonomously providingpertinent information to physicians, optimizing patient management, and enhancing medicalprocedures for more efficient care delivery and time savings.5Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Smart Hospitals and Pharmaceutical IndustrySmart hospitals employ IoT-driven intelligent healthcare, utilizing advanced technologies toimprove patient care and offer customized services for medical staff, patients, and adminis-trators. These technologies enable functions like patient monitoring, daily medical personnelmanagement, and tracking of biological specimens and medical instruments within hospitalenvironments. Furthermore, smart healthcare in the pharmaceutical sector optimizes oper-ations such as inventory management, anti-counterfeiting measures, and drug production,benefiting patients with streamlined access to physical examination systems, online appoint-ment scheduling, and enhanced doctor-patient interactions. Automated processes expeditethe patient’s medical journey, while IoT-based solutions contribute to revolutionary advance-ments, aiding in disease research and conducting more effective clinical trials. In particular,continuous real-time monitoring through smart wearable devices proves valuable in trialsrelated to lung disease, offering timely and precise information [30].10.2.2 Practical Uses of ML in Smart HealthcareML and DL have the potential to enhance the intelligence of the smart healthcare domainby leveraging their ability to uncover novel insights from data. By applying scientific andmathematical techniques, ML can reveal hidden patterns in data, facilitating more informeddecision-making. This capability can be utilized to ensure effective patient monitoring, de-tect diseases in advance, and enhance overall efficiency in smart healthcare. An exampleapplication involves the integration of electronic health records to identify patterns in infec-tious diseases, enabling the early detection of potential outbreaks. ML algorithms can play acrucial role in analyzing EHR data to swiftly identify individuals at risk, providing healthcareproviders with real-time and more accurate alerts. This proactive approach can significantlyimprove response times and aid in preventing the spread of diseases more effectively. Inaddition, effectively managing the vast amount of data generated in the healthcare domaincan only be achieved through the efficient application of ML. There exist multiple domainswithin smart healthcare where integrating ML can enhance the intelligence of healthcaresystems. This subsection provides a brief overview of some particularly notable examples.Remote Monitoring and Emergency careRemote monitoring stands out as a prime feature in smart healthcare, revolutionizing thehealthcare system. The integration of ML into healthcare systems significantly enhancesaccuracy and efficiency. In [32], Hassan et al. have proposed a context-aware framework,entitled ”Hybrid Real-time Remote Monitoring,” designed for remote patient monitoring,where authors employ a Näıve Bayes classifier in conjunction with the Whale Optimizationalgorithm. The collaborative use of these techniques aims to improve classification accuracyand achieve faster processing, thereby enhancing the efficiency of real-time patient monitor-ing. Monitoring and analyzing the patient’s glucose and blood pressure readings, supervisedlearning techniques, particularly support vector machines (SVM), predict the presence ofhypertension or abnormal levels of diabetes.Disease Prediction and PreventionWithin the expansive range of tasks that MLcan perform, prediction stands out as one of its6Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023most powerful capabilities. Whether predicting and determining the progression of diseasesin patients with chronic illnesses [35] or detecting mosquito-borne diseases earlier [36], ML hasshown the potential to revolutionize traditional healthcare, transforming it into intelligenthealthcare. This transformative potential of ML in predicting and preventing diseases notonly enhances the ability to forecast disease progression but also enables proactive measuresfor early detection and intervention.Precision MedicinePrecision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, is an innovative approach thatutilizes individuals’ genetic, environmental, and lifestyle information to recommend tailoredmedical interventions for each person [37]. The integration of ML with DL has had a profoundimpact on advancing this field. For example, in [38], Dong et al. have formulated and assesseda SVM model to predict the sensitivity of anticancer drugs using genomic data. They haveproved that by leveraging genomics, it’s possible to predict a patient’s response to cancertreatment. If implemented in clinical settings, this approach could potentially spare non-responders from unnecessary treatments, directing them toward the most effective treatmentbased on their individual genome.Decision Support SystemsDecision support systems are increasingly utilized in the healthcare industry, enhancing theability of doctors and hospitals to deliver improved treatment. While doctors remain the pri-mary decision-makers, these systems enable them to expand their knowledge through healthdata, research databases, and examinations. Decision support systems based on ML canexpedite decision-making, offer treatment suggestions, and provide justifications that helppatients’ family members understand the entire procedure. This not only allows doctorsto allocate more time to communicating with patients but also alleviates the pressure ofacquiring extensive knowledge and facilitates seeking a second opinion on decisions. A po-tential reference is available in [10], where the authors propose initial therapies or treatments.This is particularly valuable in emergency situations where time constraints necessitate swiftdecision-making. Furthermore, by integrating bottleneck attention modules to distinguishbetween abnormal and normal DFU cases, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-basedsystem for diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) has been suggested in [40].10.2.3 Healthcare Applications Using ML and IoTDespite the significant advancements in IoT-based smart healthcare, several persistent chal-lenges hinder its progress. One major obstacle is the deployment of IoT systems capable ofmanaging massive amounts of data while ensuring robust security measures for data con-fidentiality, integrity, authorization, and authentication. The sensors and devices withinthese systems generate extensive data, often referred to as big data, characterized by highlycorrelated and redundant patterns. To address this issue, ML techniques have emerged aspivotal tools. ML possesses the capability to effectively handle vast volumes of data and ex-tract meaningful insights from it [43]. Various ML and DL techniques, such as convolutionalneural networks, autoencoders (AE), deep belief networks (DBNs), long short-term memory(LSTM), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are being integrated to manage the enor-7Saifuzzaman et al.

This fusion of ML and IoT holdssignificant promise for immense progress in smart healthcare. Overall, the integration of MLtechniques with IoT technologies is leading to significant improvements in the field of smarthealthcare by addressing the challenges associated with vast data management and securityconcerns. With services such as real-time disease identification, prediction, and diagnosis,ML has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and has critical importancein remote diagnosis. Additionally, AI-powered assistive systems facilitate care for traumapatients and aid in their recovery. This section presents some examples of some of the appli-cations of ML in IoT-based smart healthcare. Fig. 10.1 presents a detailed visualization ofthe most prominent areas that can be benefited by the integration of ML and IoT in smarthealthcare.Recommendation SystemIn the realm of recommendation systems, many inventions have been proposed utilizing thefusion of IoT and ML. In [46], authors have proposed a recommendation system that uses IoTwearable devices to collect information such as previous history, demographic information,and retrieval of archived data from the sensors attached to the patient and applies various MLtechniques, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and LibSVM, to predict the occurrenceof diseases. Based on the information, a customized recommendation system is developedfrom the output.Data AggregationML techniques are integrated to carry out efficient data aggregation, as data aggregation isa major step in smart healthcare. In [48], authors have proposed a self-organized algorithm8Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023that aggregates healthcare data that has been collected via sensors. The proposed schemereduces the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space that lowers the amount oftransmitted data in the network and enhances the network lifetime, which also enhances thequality of the aggregated data.Disease DiagnosisBy combining IoT and ML, it has become feasible to conduct a more precise and currentdisease diagnosis. An enhanced DL-assisted convolutional neural network (EDCNN) hasbeen integrated into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform in [50], thereby facil-itating the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, significant progress has beenachieved in the identification of lung cancer through the implementation of sophisticatedML algorithms and IoT systems [51]. Active patient activity recognition and monitoringis another application of ML. Negra et al. (2018) employed ML techniques such as SVMs,linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest to classify the activity of a patient[52].Living AssistanceThe successful integration of IoT and ML in the field of ambient assisted living (AAL) hassignificantly enhanced the quality of life for individuals facing various disabilities and re-quiring constant care. In [55], the authors have proposed a system that utilizes wrist-worndevices to collect data, employing a supervised ML algorithm, the Decision Tree Classifier.This algorithm can recognize four different activities: walking, sitting, sleeping, and stand-ing. This real-time activity recognition serves as a constant assistant for individuals withdisabilities or elderly individuals. The adoption of supervised ML techniques is assessed toovercome the challenges associated with real-time activity recognition.Secured AnalysisAs a result of the sensitive nature of healthcare information, it is critical to ensure itsconfidentiality and security. The authors in [56] have proposed a highly secure system foran IoT-based healthcare environment, which utilizes a range of ML techniques to ensure thesecure classification of patient data.Prediction SystemBy integrating its predictive capabilities with IoT-based smart healthcare, ML is capable ofdeveloping an intelligent disease prediction system. The authors of [58] have proposed anIoT and ML-integrated cardiac arrest prediction system. The sensor acquires ECG signalscontaining information regarding cardiac activity. Following noise reduction, the acquiredcardiac information is compared to a predetermined threshold in order to make a predictionregarding the outcome. Satija et al. [60] have developed an algorithm for evaluating signalquality that is energy efficient. The algorithm analyzes ECG data and makes predictionsabout cardiovascular diseases (CVD) using ML techniques.Activity MonitoringAs mentioned earlier, IoT-enabled home healthcare systems represent a prevalent instanceof smart healthcare solutions. The incorporation of ML technologies in this domain has9Saifuzzaman et al.

Authors from [61] introduced a system capable of detectinghuman presence without relying on cameras or motion sensors. This system gathers interac-tion data by monitoring activities like reading or writing across a diverse range of devices,subsequently leveraging multiple ML classification algorithms, including the C4.5 decisiontree, linear support vector classifier (SVC), and random forest, to identify the presence of ahuman.10.3 Research ChallengesIn addressing the research challenges, the section is partitioned into two subsections, namelydomain-specific challenges and open research challenges. Exploring domain-specific chal-lenges involves an examination of recent studies in various healthcare fields, detailing theobstacles addressed within their respective domains. Regarding open research challenges,the primary issues in incorporating ML techniques into IoT-based smart healthcare are de-lineated. The challenges are vividly illustrated in Figure 10.2.10.3.1 IoT based SystemsWhile the integration of IoT brings a transformative shift to traditional healthcare systems,it also introduces a host of challenges that must be promptly addressed to fully harnessthe technology’s potential. This section explores the array of challenges encountered byIoT-based smart healthcare solutions.10Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Maintenance and Service CostA significant hurdle in IoT-based systems is the substantial cost associated with maintain-ing IoT devices. The implementation of IoT devices in smart healthcare, including sensorsand wearable devices, often involves the use of expensive communication technologies andhardware tools. This results in elevated service and maintenance costs for developing thesedevices. However, the integration of IoT in healthcare aims to enhance medical care whilereducing overall costs. Consequently, a crucial challenge emerges in overcoming this contra-diction by creating devices and sensors that require minimal maintenance.Network Disconnection and Low LatencyNetwork disconnection and low latency tolerance represent significant challenges in any IoT-based system. These issues become even more critical in the context of smart healthcare,where the system is directly linked to a person’s life. The use of diverse devices and thelarge volume of generated data can create obstacles to receiving timely information. Thisdelay can lead to critical issues, especially in emergencies such as sudden changes in bloodpressure or heart rate during remote monitoring. If data isn’t transmitted promptly, patientsmay miss out on timely treatment, posing significant health risks [14]. Additionally, forsmooth operation, IoT devices require consistent network connectivity. Any disruptions inthe network flow can impede the delivery of services, leading to similar issues as mentionedearlier. Given the numerous devices, data, and potential internet issues, ensuring theseprerequisites in every case is challenging. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate backup optionsto address such challenges [63].Data ManagementManaging, analyzing, and processing data in the realm of smart healthcare poses significantchallenges due to the diverse nature of IoT devices and the substantial volume of datathey generate. In the field of smart healthcare, there’s a constant influx of massive dataevery second. The challenges lie in efficiently collecting this data, establishing standardizedformats and structures, utilizing suitable data models, and providing semantic descriptionsof their content. Additionally, the prevalent approach of employing cloud-based solutions forhandling and analyzing this data is raising concerns. These architectures are struggling tomeet the computational demands and precise timing constraints associated with the diverseand extensive data generated in smart healthcare [63].Limitations in Energy, Computational, and Storage ResourcesIn the domain of IoT-based smart healthcare, the integration of small wearable devices andsensors introduces a critical concern: power usage. Ensuring a continuous power sourceis essential for the uninterrupted operation of these devices. Striking a balance betweenthe compact size of these devices and their energy consumption requirements presents asignificant challenge. Meeting energy requirements becomes intricate as there is limited roomto increase the device size to accommodate larger energy sources. Furthermore, restrictedstorage and computational capabilities pose obstacles to implementing complex operations,such as cryptographic models for security. Consequently, a persistent question remains: howto enhance the battery life of IoT devices while preserving their compact size? [63]11Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Obtaining Relevant InformationA significant hurdle in IoT-based smart healthcare lies in obtaining accurate signals anddata from the user’s or patient’s body. Wearable devices or sensors responsible for gatheringdiverse body measurements, such as respiratory rate, electrocardiogram (ECG) data, andblood pressure, need to be positioned correctly to efficiently capture the relevant information.For instance, identifying breathing abnormalities or monitoring respiratory rates poses achallenge due to the multitude of sounds generated by the upper body. Any misplacementof the sensor or device can result in the collection of inaccurate information. Consequently,distinguishing between various types of signals and selecting the appropriate one proves tobe a challenging task [64].Quality of ServiceThe quality of service provided by an IoT-based healthcare system in fulfilling its tasksdetermines its primary performance metric. Numerous challenges arise in meeting the qualityrequirements of IoT-based applications, including energy efficiency, sensing data quality,network resource consumption, and latency. The quality of wearable devices or sensors usedin this domain plays a crucial role in determining the system’s accuracy and the relevance ofthe collected information [63]. Consequently, the most critical factors in designing a smarthealthcare system are low latency, high response time, high scalability, and the integrationof backup options.10.3.2 ML based SystemsThe incorporation of ML has had a profound impact on revolutionizing the healthcare do-main, transforming it into a smart and intelligent system. However, implementing ML inthe smart healthcare domain presents several challenges. This subsection provides a conciseoverview of the challenges associated with integrating ML into the realm of smart healthcare.Preparation of Data for ML AlgorithmsPreparing data for ML algorithms is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with physi-ological or health-related data. Such data is often collected from diverse sources and exists inunstructured or semi-structured formats. Therefore, prior to applying any ML algorithm, itis crucial to preprocess the data to avoid potential impacts on model training and classifica-tion accuracy. This involves the critical integration of data from different sources, addressingoutliers, noise, missing and inconsistent data, and transforming it into a standardized format.Dimensionality reduction may also be necessary. Moreover, data may require preprocessingfor storage efficiency or to uphold the quality of data mining processes [65]. Given the natureand volume of healthcare data, this process is notably challenging. Additionally, incorpo-rating patient-specific factors, which vary for each patient, poses a considerable challenge toachieve.Imbalanced DataClass imbalance is a prevalent factor in ML, occurring when the distribution of classes withina dataset is uneven. Specifically, one class comprises a significantly larger number of recordsthan the other. In such cases, the implementation of any ML model tends to be biased12Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023toward the majority class. In healthcare, because ML assumes that classes are normallydistributed, this bias could mean that the model does better at predicting outcomes formore common health conditions but worse on the minority class, which could potentiallyinclude critical conditions [66]. Furthermore, if the model exhibits bias toward a specificclass, it can impact decision-making, lead to false alarms, overlook rare conditions, andultimately have implications for patient health.Complex Dimentionality and Large Training DatasetData collected in the healthcare sector is typically high-dimensional, and while high dimen-sionality often provides relevant information for understanding patient conditions, applyingML algorithms to such data may lead to lower accuracy. Additionally, dealing with the vastamount of healthcare data poses a significant challenge. ML algorithms require an adequateamount of accurate data to effectively fulfill their roles. For instance, the application of DLto image-based health data demands a substantial and high-quality training dataset. Ensur-ing the validity and accuracy of the images is crucial. However, obtaining such image data,meeting both quantity and quality requirements, remains a challenging task [67]. Further-more, any increase in the size of the training data contributes to the memory complexity ofthe model.Performance of ML modelsCreating an effective model that performs well across diverse healthcare datasets is a world-wide challenge. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in image-relatedtasks, while recurrent neural networks are proficient in waveform analysis. However, in thecontext of smart healthcare, where data is sourced from various origins, the application of aspecific model may not necessarily yield optimal performance. Several factors contribute tothe overall performance of ML implementations in smart healthcare. These include:1. Dimensionality: The high dimensionality of data can impact the effectiveness of MLmodels, especially when dealing with complex and varied healthcare datasets.2. Noisy Data: The presence of noise or irrelevant information in the data can hinder theaccuracy and reliability of ML algorithms.3. Redundant Data: Duplicate or redundant data may lead to inefficiencies in modeltraining and may not contribute substantially to the learning process.4. Outliers: Outliers can significantly influence the performance of ML models by skewingthe training process and affecting the generalization of the model.5. Number of Attributes: The number of attributes or features in datasets can posechallenges, especially when dealing with a large and varied set of healthcare data.Addressing Ethical and Legal ChallengesEntrusting a ML model with the entire responsibility of processing raw medical data ischallenging. Involving a medical professional becomes necessary to categorize and interpretthe medical data. Numerous ethical and legal concerns surround the implementation of ML13Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023in healthcare. For instance, the output of a DL algorithm applied to healthcare data canbe challenging to explain logically. Lack of involvement from a medical professional in suchscenarios may pose severe threats and potential harm.Evolution of ML with changing infrastructureHealthcare facilities adapt to patient demands, evolving in management, infrastructure, data,and training requirements. The dynamic nature of healthcare advancement poses a crucialquestion: Will the implemented ML model align and evolve with changing infrastructurewhile maintaining its original prediction logic? [68] Addressing this challenge promptly isimperative.10.3.3 IoT and ML based SystemsIoT and ML have collaborated to bring about significant advancements in the field of smarthealthcare. However, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome because of the inherentcomplexities of the individual fields as well as the complications that arise when combiningthese two fields. This section discusses the open research challenges that are associated withML and IoT-based smart healthcare systems.Table 10.2: Open research challengesChallenges Type Issues Relevant workTransmission of Correlated data [69, 70]Resource Management Agreement [71]Resource ScarcityAcceptable level of accuracy [72]Compromisation of transmitted data [73, 74]Management of heterogenous data [75, 76]Security and PrivacyExisting techniques infeasibilityInteroperability [77, 78]Distinguishing True and False Signals [64]Data and ML Model Synchronization [31]Limited energy supplies [79]Success of the underlying applications [80]Energy Algorithms [81, 82]Energy managementOptimizationRouting ApproachNetwork performanceWays of gaining insights [83]Innovative noise removal techniques [84]Underlying topologies [85, 86, 87, 88]Big data AnalyticsPerformance Dynamics anddiverse environments[89, 90, 91, 92, 93]Open Research ChallengesThis section discusses the open research challenges in the domain of IoT and ML-based smarthealthcare. The summarization is represented in Table 10.2.14Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Resource ConstraintThe scarcity of resources, including sensors, devices, actuators, and microcontrollers, presentsthe greatest obstacle for the development of smart healthcare. Because of their relativelytiny size, these devices have limited processing capacity and poor computational capability.As a result, it is difficult to manage the resources by making sure that they are being usedeffectively reference [72, 94, 95]. In addition, the data that is produced by these devices withlimited resources is strongly correlated with one another, redundant, and contains patternsthat are quite similar to one another. Because of this, transmitting various kinds of data overthe network for the purpose of analysis or storage consumes a significant amount of energy,which in turn lowers the quality of service and results in low throughput. This problem ofscarce resources has been mitigated to some extent as a result of the integration of cloudservices with the IoT; however, integration of cloud services leads to increased complexity,greater costs, and a higher level of required maintenance. In addition to this, these datacome from a wide variety of sources, the quality of which may vary, as well as difficulties suchas noisy data, inconsistent data, and a great number of other problems. The aforementionedchallenges render ML-based data aggregation methods incapable of maintaining the integrityof the data, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption. The majority of current ML-based data aggregation methods are not energy efficient as a result of these concerns.In addition, effective management of resources is a critical challenge in smart healthcare.Because of the unique qualities of IoT networks, a number of issues related to resourcemanagement, including resource discovery, modeling, provisioning, scheduling, estimation,and monitoring, continue to be of greater importance than they were in the past [71]. Inaddition, the process of allocating resources is not nearly as efficiently optimized as it shouldbe to increase the overall quality of the service.Real-time and Continuous LearningIn smart healthcare, sensors continuously gather real-time data, which is then fed into MLalgorithms for analysis. This scenario persists as data is captured moment by moment inreal time. Continuous learning, or online ML, involves learning from the ever-increasingdata while retaining knowledge from previous datasets. While online ML appears to be animpactful solution, it has constraints, one of which is catastrophic forgetfulness. In thisphenomenon, the ML model suddenly forgets what it has learned, leading to a significantreduction in performance [96].Data and ML Model SynchronizationIn the landscape of IoT and ML-based smart healthcare, data from heterogeneous devicesand sensors undergoes collection and transmission to the cloud for ML algorithm applica-tion and analysis. However, the heterogeneity in sensor internal clock structures introduceschallenges in synchronization, necessitating the implementation of smart gateways. It be-comes imperative to synchronize the collected data on a temporal basis before transmittingit to the cloud for preprocessing, model training, and development. In cases lacking edgedevices, this entire process unfolds in the cloud, where decisions and alerts are generated.Any disruption in network and cloud services poses a severe threat to patients, potentiallyendangering their lives. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to design the system in a waythat ensures data synchronization on local servers. For instance, Hassan et al. proposed a15Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023hybrid model, acknowledging a drawback involving the downloading and copying of the MLmodel from the cloud to local devices [31]. Addressing this significant challenge is crucialfor achieving optimal outcomes in smart healthcare systems.Security and PrivacyIntegration of IoT into healthcare has enabled a number of benefits that were unimaginablejust a few years ago, including individualized and immediate access to medical care, remoteand continuous monitoring, and more. This has been achieved through the collaboration ofhealthcare devices and technology, which provide users with an extensive array of healthcareservices. Between 2023 and 2028, the global healthcare IoT market is projected to expandby 12.32%, culminating in a valuation of around $178 billion by 20281. Despite the ongoingand revolutionary progress in smart healthcare, the security and privacy implications of theimplemented solution must be taken into account due to the sensitive nature of health data[97, 98, 99]. The transmission of these data upstream not only has detrimental effects on thedata aggregation techniques that are foundational to the system but also harms its overallperformance. This leaves the network susceptible to a variety of threats, including denial ofservice, eavesdropping, Sybil, sinkhole, and sleep deprivation attacks. This continues to bea threat as the network continues to expand and a greater number of hardware and softwarevulnerabilities are introduced [73].Furthermore, the inclusion of personally identifiable information in healthcare data, in-cluding but not limited to personal details, family history, electronic medical records, andgenomic data, gives rise to concerns regarding the sensitivity of the data and its owner. Anestimated 72% of malicious traffic is directed at healthcare data with the intention of exploit-ing the system [74]. Hence, it is critical to ensure the confidentiality and protection of thisdata against hackers through the implementation of diverse security and privacy protocols[100]. In addition to these, additional obstacles may include inadequate physical security,misconfigured devices, or network vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the task of safeguardingdata privacy and security is considerably complicated by the fact that the majority of thedevices within the system are heterogeneous and are administered by third parties [75, 76].Due to the limited resources inherent in IoT devices, the existing security features are notfeasible enough to mitigate the issues.InteroperabilityThe combination of ML and the IoT has sped up advancements in medical care; however, thereal obstacle is the absence of global standards that are recognized and approved of by allrelevant authorities. Because of the diverse range of applications and application domains,it is becoming an increasingly difficult task to maintain a global collaborative environment,whether the topic at hand is the selection of technologies or algorithms [77, 78]. Increasedthroughput, decreased unplanned outages, and lower maintenance costs are some of theadvantages that come along with the use of devices that are interoperable.Distinguishing True and False SignalsVarious wearable devices play a crucial role in smart healthcare, employing different ML1Healthcare IoT - Worldwide, available at: www.statista.com.16Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023algorithms based on the application. However, the challenging aspect lies in accuratelydistinguishing between genuine and false signals. For instance, in a fall detection system, anaccelerometer is typically utilized to identify falls, with a ML algorithm analyzing the dataand sending alerts to caregivers. Yet, differentiating between a fall and a rapid movementor regular activities poses a formidable challenge. The system must exhibit robustness todiscern any sudden movement, such as bending down or picking up an object, to preventthe introduction of false data into the ML algorithm, thereby avoiding the generation ofinaccurate alerts. Furthermore, enhancing research data for fall detection is challenging dueto the infrequency of such incidents [64].Big Data AnalyticsManaging the enormous quantities of data that are consistently produced by connected med-ical devices is one of the most significant and crucial challenges that smart healthcare hasto overcome. It is anticipated that the growth of the IoT in the future will be more exag-gerated, which means that a greater quantity of data will be produced that is unstructured,raw, and highly correlated. These data are passed through the network and are used foranalysis as well as decision-making. The data may contain correlations, redundant values,or null values. This has a negative impact on the performance of the network and makesit more vulnerable to a wide variety of different kinds of attacks [101]. In addition to this,gaining useful insights from these data is a challenging task for a variety of ML algorithmsbecause it requires extensive preprocessing of data, which takes a lot of time, and managingthis massive amount of data is very difficult [83]. It is essential to have this in place so thata variety of ML and DL techniques can be utilized to facilitate improved decision-making.In addition, because IoT devices produce real-time data, it is extremely difficult to applyML algorithms to real-time data and carry out a variety of operations in order to respondappropriately.At present, ML-based data aggregation techniques are inadequately optimized in termsof the nature of the data, which hinders their ability to identify outliers while maintainingservice quality and efficiency. Moreover, the correlation between data aggregation and thefundamental topology of the network is more evident. The efficacy of these methodologies issignificantly influenced by the foundational topologies [85, 86, 87]. To improve the quality ofaggregated data and enhance data signal quality, it is critical to reduce noise, which is quitechallenging to accomplish with current methods given the nature of the data. Furthermore,existing methodologies fail to adequately support the execution of diverse data analysisoperations in a heterogeneous setting, a significant obstacle given the substantial influenceof heterogeneity in the domain of intelligent healthcare [89, 90, 92].Challenges in Existing SystemsIn this section, various domains have been examined within the realm of H-IoT to ascertainthe challenges encountered by researchers when proposing a new architecture. Specifically,recent literature has been reviewed encompassing different metrics, including sensor-leveldata, augmented reality, electroencephalogram (EEG) information, cognitive load assess-ment, diagnostic systems, and H-IoT quality of service (QoS). The identified challenges havebeen organized and presented in Table 10.3.17Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Table 10.3: Challenges considered in various healthcare domains ( means considered andmeans does not)ChallengesConsidered(Metric)Reference (Sensor Level)[46](AR)[102](EEGinformation)[103](CLA)[104](Diagnosissystem)[105](H-IoT QoS)[106]Feature extractionCost-effectivenessPersonalisationEfficiencyUsefulnessBig data analyticsScalabilityMaintainabilityEnvironmental factorsand sentiment statusReal-time dataSecurity and PrivacyAsthana et al. [46] have proposed a recommendation system that employs ML to classifyinput data and associate disorders with corresponding wearable devices. Their architecturaldesign addresses the extraction of an individual’s health conditions and the necessary mea-surements for monitoring. Furthermore, identifying the most cost-effective set of wearabledevices for measuring these monitored parameters is a challenging endeavor, especially giventhe substantial proliferation of options in the contemporary market.The field of IoT smart healthcare encompasses fall-detection services. FallCare facesthree prominent issues: (1) constrained computational resources on the Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2); (2) a lack of live streaming capability for detection, relying on images, fall video clips,or event notifications; and (3) poor scalability and maintainability for updating learningmodels across distributed devices. In response to these challenges, the authors of [102] haveintroduced CTPhone, a fall identification system based on a smart home sensor network.With widespread connectivity, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential toempower individuals to directly control objects, such as smart home appliances or assistiverobots, using their thoughts. In the domain of EEG metrics, Zhang et al. [103] have proposeda unified DL framework aimed at enabling human-thing cognitive interactivity. Specifically,the authors utilized EEG signals for speech generation and automation. Nevertheless, chal-lenges pertaining to the accuracy of signal interpretation and the time-consuming nature ofthese tasks impede the realization of this vision.Raw brain signals can be acquired using var-ious technologies, including electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIR), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). These signals often exhibit low fidelity, aresusceptible to noise and concentration issues, and therefore pose challenges for accurate sig-nal interpretation. Furthermore, the preprocessing of brain signals and subsequent featureengineering are both time-consuming and heavily dependent on human domain expertise.In [104], Arruda et al. have proposed a model for measuring motion using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and they determined the device’s location based onthe measured signal. They have extracted the data by addressing time-delayed movementsand random signal lengths before extracting features from the windowed signals. To enhance18Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023system accuracy and reduce computational complexity, Arruda et al. have implementeda feature selection algorithm to decrease the amount of data requiring processing. Theimprovement in accuracy was contingent on the choice of various classifiers, adjustments tothe feature selection algorithm, or modifications to the window length.Ara et al. [105] have conducted a case study to assess the feasibility of integratingIoT and ML for enhancing the diabetes management system. Their vision was to design acost-effective system capable of transmitting large volumes of generated data to the cloud.Furthermore, the authors have aimed to create a versatile tool that is easy to develop andproficient in data analysis and presentation.In a related study by Fafoutis et al. [106], the authors have sought to extend sensor bat-tery life. To achieve this, the model needed to be energy-efficient. Consequently, they havedeveloped an SVM classifier that effectively segregates essential information from redundantdata, resulting in a remarkable increase in sensor battery life from 13 to 997 days. However,it is essential to note that cost considerations play a pivotal role in this context. EmbeddedML not only limits the advantages of collecting and storing copious raw data but also addsits own financial implications.10.4 Future Work DirectionsThe current state of smart healthcare has reached a level that was unimaginable just a fewyears ago, particularly due to the incorporation of IoT and ML into the process. However,there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, and there are also a greatmany areas that have not yet been discovered but that need to be put into practice asquickly as possible in order to improve this field even further. This section presents potentialdirections for the future based on the challenges that have been covered in the section thatcame before it.10.4.1 IoT based SystemsSmart healthcare based on the IoT encounters various challenges, as extensively discussedin the previous section. This section outlines a comprehensive roadmap for future researchbased on the identified challenges.Using Predictive Maintenance ApproachImplementing predictive maintenance procedures is an effective solution to tackle the chal-lenges linked to maintenance costs. In [107], authors have proposed a predictive maintenanceprocess for IoT-enabled manufacturing. They use a convolutional neural network and longshort-term memory for fault prediction and deep reinforcement learning to optimize pro-duction control and schedule maintenance. This approach aims to deliver more precisemaintenance services, leading to an overall reduction in costs. Additionally, developing adockerized blockchain client enables efficient resource utilization and optimized hardwareconfigurations, contributing to lower maintenance costs and enhanced resource efficiency[108].19Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Developing DTN based SystemSingh et al. [109] have proposed the development of delay-tolerant networks (DTN) as a po-tential solution for network disruptions and latency issues in IoT systems. DTNs, designedto function in challenging conditions and across extensive distances, present a promisingapproach to effectively address both network stability and latency concerns. Furthermore,Namasudra et al. [110] suggest that integrating ML models can enhance predictive capabil-ities, allowing for the anticipation of network faults before severe disruptions occur.Exploring Alternatives for Data ManagementExploring alternative options for data handling is necessary due to the various challengesposed by existing methods. Hence, future research should focus on leveraging fog computingfor data management, aiming for scalability and diverse data storage formats. Proposedsolutions should include features like data replication to enhance availability for multipleuser applications. It is crucial to address issues such as reliability, information validity, andoverall performance, considering the limited resources of small IoT devices (e.g., storage,processing, and energy capacity) [111]. Moreover, researchers have explored the integrationof data trust methods to identify anomalies or untrustworthy data. This approach enhancesdata analysis and improves predictions in smart healthcare systems [112].Introduce Optimization TechniquesTo address the issues of storage, energy, and computational limitations, significant efforts arerequired to optimize and develop effective energy protocols, particularly in fog computingsystems, including virtual and ad hoc fog systems. These efforts should encompass aspectslike network and computing resource optimization, as well as a shift toward environmentallyfriendly energies, such as renewable energy sources [113]. Moreover, implementing ResNet50and MobileNetV2 as backbones with quantization techniques has proven to be an efficientand lightweight solution, contributing to the reduction of computational power in IoT-basedsystems [114].Introduce Contact-less Approach for Data CollectionTo address the issue of identifying relevant data, a contactless approach, such as usingcameras for data collection, can be introduced. The field of contactless methods holdssubstantial potential for future research, though it presents several unresolved challenges.Consequently, given the current scenario, a complete shift to a contactless method maynot be a practical option. Hence, a more viable approach could involve a combinationof both contact and contactless methods for enhanced reliability and success. Moreover,incorporating contactless feature extraction, along with signal processing techniques likePCA, ICA, filtering, and supervised ML methods, could offer a more robust solution [64].10.4.2 ML based SystemsThe challenges faced by the ML-based healthcare system have been explored in Section10.3.2. This section provides some future research aspects based on these challenges to makethe smart healthcare system more robust and efficient.20Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Using DL method for Data PreparationExploring future research opportunities, one potential area lies in utilizing solutions basedon DL for addressing data preparation issues. One prominent example is in medical imag-ing, where the reliance on manual efforts for anomaly detection has been a longstandingpractice. DL processes offer a promising solution by automating this detection process,thereby enhancing the accuracy of medical imaging [115]. However, the implementation ofDL methods faces a major obstacle in the need for large volumes of data. Therefore, futureresearch must address how DL can be seamlessly integrated while tackling existing issuesor if alternative approaches may be more impactful in this context. Moreover, a crucialaspect is the inclusion of patient-specific factors in data aggregation. This can be achievedby integrating aggregators at the edge, facilitating a more personalized and context-awarehealthcare approach.Optimization techniques for High Dimentionality and Data ImbalanceTo mitigate challenges like high dimensionality in data and biases arising from data imbal-ance, upcoming research should concentrate on optimizing model architecture, enhancingtraining and validation procedures, and investigating sampling techniques or introducing en-semble learning [118]. It is crucial to ensure that the original data remains unaltered whileaddressing these challenges in order to enhance the effectiveness of ML in smart healthcare.Developing Scalable Platform for Big DataIn order to tackle the challenges associated with handling extensive volumes of medical data,the development of scalable, robust, and elastic cloud platforms is imperative for effectivebig data management in the healthcare domain. Moreover, future research endeavors couldconcentrate on implementing models based on MapReduce [33]. MapReduce-based modelsoffer notable advantages, including higher scalability and improved performance throughparallel processing. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities inherent in MapRe-duce, healthcare applications can efficiently handle the massive datasets involved in medicalanalytics, paving the way for more effective and scalable ML solutions in the healthcaredomain.Use Open and Interpretable AIOpen and interpretable AI offers a potential solution to address legal, ethical, and socialissues arising from ML in healthcare by focusing on enhancing the understandability ofmachine decisions [117]. It aids in building trust, reducing bias, and enhancing human un-derstanding. Open and interpretable AI addresses various challenges and issues, therebyimproving the overall experience of service delivery, traceability, and confidence in the use ofAI and ML tools in healthcare. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on interpretabil-ity and explanatory techniques for ML models within the Smart Healthcare Management(SHM) framework.10.4.3 IoT and ML based SystemsIn this section, we have discussed the future directions of IoT and ML-based smart healthcarechallenges.21Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023Developing Lightweight and Energy Efficient SolutionSmart healthcare issues, such as high energy consumption and the lack of an effective solutionfor resource management, are of the utmost importance. As a result, it is essential to developan innovative, lightweight, and energy-efficient ML-based data aggregation algorithm becausethe majority of the currently available solutions do not include these characteristics. Inaddition, it is necessary to develop innovative schemes that are able to divide the taskamong the various components of the IoT. These schemes should not only be able to solvethe problem of resource constraints that are present in these networks, but they should alsobe able to provide a solution that has an acceptable level of accuracy [72].Continuous Learning for Handling Synchronization IssueAddressing model and data synchronization issues in smart healthcare requires future re-search efforts. Shah et al. [122] have emphasized the need for ML algorithms to facilitatecontinuous learning from clinical data and apply this learning to new data. Implementingcontinuous learning is challenging in practice, and further research is needed to develop mod-els that can emulate human brain-like thinking processes. Moreover, the exploration of fogcomputing-based solutions has gained popularity in recent times, presenting an avenue forfurther investigation to achieve improved results [123].Utilize Privacy-Enhancing AlgorithmsPreserving the integrity and confidentiality of health records, which contain sensitive in-formation and are susceptible to breaches, is of utmost importance [119]. Therefore, it isnecessary to develop energy-efficient and lightweight ML data aggregation algorithms thatare also secure. It is necessary for the solutions to be able to preserve confidentiality anddefend against breaches of privacy using a variety of data privacy protection algorithms[120]. Integration of various data protection strategies, such as blockchain and differentialprivacy, is also open to consideration. This would result in improved data security. De-veloping improved access control methods is necessary to maintain the safety and securityof the network. Additionally, the devices comprising the IoT should be designed to betamper-resistant, safeguarding them from physical damage [121].Designing Appropriate DevicesAccurately distinguishing between true and false data collected via wearable devices presentsa substantial hurdle in the healthcare domain. Additionally, adaptability is crucial for up-coming projects, especially in scenarios like movement detection where sensors must be ver-satile to accommodate the unique gait data of each individual. Exploring both contact-basedand contactless methods, along with the development of DL models capable of discerningbetween genuine and false values, can be instrumental in addressing these challenges.Ensuring Semantic InteroperabilityBuilding a globally acknowledged standard and protocol infrastructure is an absolute ne-cessity to tackle interoperability issues. One potential approach that could be taken in thefuture is to maintain the semantic interoperability of healthcare information [121]. This in-volves ensuring that when various healthcare systems or devices share information with oneanother, they are able to comprehend the meaning and context of the data in a manner that22Saifuzzaman et al. Revised on January 12, 2023is both consistent and accurate. It is essential for effective communication and collaborationbetween various technologies used in the healthcare field that they speak the same languagewhen exchanging important medical data.Integrating ML and Optimization MethodsIt is crucial to develop tools and methods for big data analytics that can perform analysis andextract the necessary information. Developing novel noise removal techniques is crucial forpreprocessing the data, enabling more effective analysis and improving the data signal. Moreimportantly, because IoT devices produce real-time data, utilizing ML techniques for real-time information monitoring and providing prompt responses is a very interesting future areafor research. This could be a topic of study in the near future. In addition, the performancedegradation of data aggregation techniques brought on by the topologies underlying themis a major cause for concern. It is necessary to conduct research on them in a dynamic andheterogeneous environment [89, 90, 92].In addition to the aforementioned pathways, there are some broader areas for futureresearch. For example, no comprehensive investigation has been conducted on these tech-nologies to determine which big data technologies and ML techniques are most applicable toIoT healthcare. Furthermore, studies that interlink the two cross domains, i.e., big data an-alytics and healthcare, are still in their early stages, and as a result, the research communityneeds to pay even more attention to these types of studies.10.5 ConclusionsIn the 21st century, IoT has thrived, enhancing daily decision-making and introducing ser-vices like pay-as-you-use models. The integration of IoT into modern life aims to improvequality of life by incorporating smart devices and technologies. Simultaneously, ML ad-dresses business challenges through predictive analytics. In recent years, both ML and IoThave independently impacted healthcare, with ML focusing on algorithm development andIoT facilitating real-time monitoring. Researchers are now frequently exploring ML solutionswithin IoT-based healthcare, providing significant benefits in statistical and predictive analy-sis. This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to IoT-based smart healthcare withML, catering to newcomers interested in exploring this field. It covers research challengesand offers insights for future contributions. The chapter divides into three main sections:IoT-based smart healthcare, ML integration in traditional healthcare, and the synergy ofboth IoT and ML. It discusses real-life applications in these domains, addresses challengesin developing new architectural solutions, and outlines future research directions.Overall, the chapter establishes a strong foundation for researchers keen on practical ap-plications or innovative theoretical approaches in the realm of smart healthcare, providing adeep understanding of the challenges associated with ML and IoT applications. While theinherent and individual capabilities of IoT and ML create an ideal cross-domain synergy fordeveloping IoT and ML-based smart healthcare, several challenges still exist. Firstly, thereare challenges faced by IoT and ML individually in healthcare and other domains. Secondly,issues arise with the cross-domain combination of IoT and ML, as both domains present23Springer Studies in Computational Intelligencevarious complexities. Therefore, future research should primarily address the inherent is-sues of each domain while also tackling the complexities of integrating these two domains.Considering the persistent research challenges, an appropriate approach could lead to thetransformative changes in healthcare that the world anticipates.References[1] D.

Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Public Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Approach to Disease Prediction, Prevention and Management SEEJPH Volume XXVI, 2025, ISSN: 2197-5248; Posted:04-01-25 901 | P a g e Healthcare disparities, driven by socioeconomic factors, geography, and access to care, exacerbate these challenges, leaving certain populations more vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Emerging health threats, such as antibiotic resistance and new infectious diseases, further complicate efforts to ensure global health security. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to address many of these challenges by harnessing large-scale health data. With access to electronic health records (EHRs), genetic data, real-time surveillance data from wearables and mobile apps, and public health reports, ML algorithms can analyze complex datasets to identify patterns, predict disease outbreaks, and personalize treatment plans. By utilizing this data, ML can improve early diagnosis, streamline resource allocation, and enhance public health decision-making, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and more equitable healthcare delivery. 2. Relevance of Machine Learning Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In the context of public health, ML plays a critical role in improving healthcare delivery and outcomes by analyzing large and diverse datasets. Predictive modeling, one of the key applications of ML, involves using historical and real-time data to forecast future events, such as disease outbreaks, patient admissions, or health outcomes. Pattern recognition enables ML to detect hidden relationships and trends in health data that may be too complex for traditional statistical methods. Additionally, ML’s ability to automate decision-making processes allows health systems to respond faster and more accurately, reducing human error and improving efficiency. ML’s relevance to public health lies in its capacity to process vast amounts of health-related data and provide actionable insights. By integrating ML into health systems, policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers can make more informed, data-driven decisions, from predicting the spread of infectious diseases to personalizing treatments for chronic conditions. As healthcare systems continue to evolve, ML’s ability to analyze diverse health data will become increasingly vital in addressing global health challenges and achieving more effective, equitable, and sustainable healthcare outcomes. Key Areas Where Machine Learning is Impacting Public Health 1. Epidemiological Prediction and Surveillance Disease Outbreak Prediction: Machine learning (ML) has become an invaluable tool in predicting disease outbreaks by analyzing large datasets and recognizing patterns that can signal the onset of an epidemic. Time series forecasting models and deep learning algorithms, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can process historical data on disease prevalence, social behavior, climate patterns, and population movement to predict future outbreaks. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ML models helped predict infection rates, hospital admissions, and regional hotspots based on real-time data. Similarly, ML has been used to predict seasonal outbreaks like influenza, giving public health officials the ability to implement timely preventive measures and allocate resources effectively. Surveillance Systems: Machine learning is also revolutionizing real-time disease surveillance. Mobile health applications, wearable devices, and big data sources such as social media activity or search engine queries can feed continuous data into ML models to monitor and track disease trends. For example, ML-driven systems can analyze data from wearable sensors to detect early signs of infectious diseases in individuals before they show symptoms, allowing for early intervention. Furthermore, big data sources can be used to identify clusters of diseases or health anomalies, facilitating rapid responses and targeted public health interventions. By providing timely and accurate surveillance, ML enhances global and local disease monitoring capabilities. 2. Chronic Disease Management Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: ML models have made significant contributions to managing chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Public Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Approach to Disease Prediction, Prevention and Management SEEJPH Volume XXVI, 2025, ISSN: 2197-5248; Posted:04-01-25 902 | P a g e by predicting patient outcomes and optimizing treatment plans. Supervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, are used to predict the progression of diseases based on historical health data, patient demographics, and lifestyle factors. For instance, ML models can identify high-risk individuals for diabetes by analyzing their medical history, blood sugar levels, and other factors. In the case of cardiovascular diseases, predictive models can assess the likelihood of a patient experiencing heart attacks or strokes and recommend preventive measures. Similarly, cancer detection models, which analyze medical imaging data and genetic information, have proven effective in early detection and personalized treatment plans, improving patient outcomes. Personalized Medicine: Machine learning also plays a crucial role in personalized medicine by tailoring health interventions to individual patients based on their unique health data. By integrating information such as genomics, lifestyle factors, and environmental conditions, ML models can recommend highly individualized treatments and interventions. For example, in cancer therapy, ML can analyze genetic mutations in tumors to identify the most effective treatment options, improving the likelihood of successful outcomes. Personalized medicine powered by ML is shifting healthcare from a one-size-fits-all approach to precision care, where treatments are optimized to each patient's specific genetic and environmental context. 3. Health Outcomes Prediction Risk Stratification:ML algorithms are increasingly being used for risk stratification, which involves identifying individuals at high risk of developing serious health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. By analyzing a combination of factors such as medical history, lab results, demographics, and lifestyle choices, ML models can predict the likelihood of future health events. These predictions help healthcare providers implement preventive measures such as lifestyle changes, early screenings, or targeted medications, ultimately improving long-term health outcomes. For instance, ML models have been used to predict the onset of cardiovascular diseases in patients with diabetes, enabling early intervention to prevent complications. Hospital Readmission Prediction: Predicting hospital readmissions is another critical area where ML is making an impact. ML models use patient data from electronic health records (EHR), including medical history, treatments received, and social determinants of health, to predict the likelihood that a patient will be readmitted to the hospital after discharge. These predictive models can help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive actions, such as scheduling follow-up appointments or providing additional care instructions, thereby reducing unnecessary readmissions and optimizing resource allocation. This contributes to more efficient healthcare systems, improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs. 4. Public Health Policy and Resource Allocation Optimizing Healthcare Systems: Machine learning is essential for optimizing healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited settings or during public health crises. ML models can help allocate hospital resources more efficiently, including hospital bed capacity, medical staff, and medical supplies, ensuring they are deployed where they are most needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ML was used to model and predict patient flows, enabling better management of hospital admissions, ICU beds, and ventilators. Additionally, ML has been crucial in optimizing vaccine distribution by predicting where demand is highest based on demographic data and disease prevalence, ensuring equitable access to vaccines. Policy Development: Machine learning is also being used to inform public health policy by simulating the potential impact of various health interventions. By analyzing historical data and running simulations, ML models can help policymakers assess the effectiveness of interventions such as vaccination campaigns, lockdown measures, or health education programs. For instance, ML models can simulate how different strategies would affect the spread of infectious diseases, allowing public health authorities to make data-driven decisions on policies that will maximize population health outcomes. These tools empower policymakers Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Public Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Approach to Disease Prediction, Prevention and Management SEEJPH Volume XXVI, 2025, ISSN: 2197-5248; Posted:04-01-25 903 | P a g e to make proactive and evidence-based decisions, which are especially crucial in times of crisis, such as during pandemics. In conclusion, machine learning is transforming public health by enabling more accurate predictions, personalized interventions, and efficient resource allocation. From disease outbreak prediction to chronic disease management and policy development, ML’s potential to optimize healthcare systems and improve population health outcomes is vast. However, continued investment in technology, data security, and ethical practices is essential to ensure these advancements are both effective and equitable for all individuals. Ethical and Social Implications of Machine Learning in Public Health 1. Bias and Fairness One of the most significant ethical concerns regarding machine learning (ML) in public health is the risk of bias and unfair outcomes, especially when algorithms are trained on biased or incomplete data. ML models, if not properly managed, can perpetuate or even amplify existing biases, leading to unfair healthcare predictions and disparities. For example, racial, socioeconomic, and geographic factors often influence healthcare access and outcomes, and if these factors are inadequately represented in training datasets, ML models can produce biased predictions. This could result in underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of diseases among marginalized populations, further exacerbating health inequalities. To improve fairness and reduce bias, several methods are being developed. One approach involves ensuring diverse and representative data collection, so that models are trained on datasets that encompass a wide range of demographics, medical histories, and health conditions. Techniques like bias detection algorithms and fairness-aware learning can also be employed to assess and correct any disparities in predictions. Additionally, involving a diverse group of healthcare professionals, data scientists, and ethicists in the design and deployment of ML models can help identify potential biases early in the process. Regular audits of ML models and the implementation of fairness metrics during model evaluation are also essential to maintaining ethical standards in healthcare predictions. 2. Data Privacy and Security The use of sensitive health data to train ML models raises important ethical issues related to patient privacy, informed consent, and data security. In the healthcare sector, patient data is highly confidential and must be protected to maintain trust and comply with legal frameworks such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S. However, in the era of big data and machine learning, large datasets often require the aggregation of health information from diverse sources, which can increase the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. To address these concerns, strong data privacy measures must be implemented, including anonymization and encryption of patient data, ensuring that it cannot be traced back to an individual without consent. Informed consent should be transparent and comprehensive, outlining how data will be used and the potential risks involved in participating in ML-driven healthcare initiatives. Federated learning, which allows for decentralized model training, is one method that can reduce the need for centralized data storage, helping to mitigate privacy risks while still benefiting from the power of collaborative machine learning. Additionally, strict adherence to data governance frameworks and continuous monitoring of data security practices is essential to protect patient information. 3. Transparency and Accountability Transparency and accountability are crucial when deploying machine learning models in healthcare, as the decisions made by these models can significantly impact patient outcomes. Healthcare professionals and the general public need to understand how and why ML models make specific decisions to trust them in critical situations. This is where explainable AI (XAI) becomes vital. XAI techniques, such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), allow clinicians to better interpret and Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Public Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Approach to Disease Prediction, Prevention and Management SEEJPH Volume XXVI, 2025, ISSN: 2197-5248; Posted:04-01-25 904 | P a g e explain the decisions made by ML algorithms, thereby fostering trust and enabling informed decision-making. Without transparency, there is a risk of healthcare professionals blindly relying on black-box models that lack interpretability, which could lead to unintended consequences, such as incorrect treatment recommendations or failure to account for important patient-specific factors. Additionally, clear accountability frameworks need to be established to determine responsibility when errors occur, whether due to flaws in the ML model, misinterpretation of model outputs, or human error. Ensuring that ML systems are transparent, understandable, and accountable will be crucial in maintaining ethical standards in healthcare and safeguarding patient interests. In summary, while machine learning has the potential to revolutionize public health, it must be approached with careful consideration of its ethical and social implications. Addressing biases, ensuring data privacy and security, and promoting transparency and accountability will be key to ensuring that ML applications in public health are fair, ethical, and ultimately beneficial to all individuals. Case Studies: Case Study 1: Using ML in Predicting COVID-19 Trends and Vaccine Distribution The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of machine learning (ML) in public health responses, particularly in predicting the spread of the virus and optimizing vaccine distribution. ML models, including time series forecasting models and deep learning algorithms, were applied to analyze historical data, social mobility trends, and other epidemiological factors to predict the spread of COVID-19. For instance, models like Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models, enhanced with ML, provided more accurate projections of infection rates, enabling governments and healthcare providers to implement timely interventions such as lockdowns or resource allocation. Additionally, ML was pivotal in optimizing vaccine distribution strategies. By analyzing demographic data, geographic distribution, healthcare infrastructure, and population vulnerability, ML models helped identify regions with the highest need and ensured that vaccines were distributed efficiently. Reinforcement learning algorithms also played a role in adapting distribution strategies in real time, based on evolving infection rates and vaccination progress. This dynamic approach allowed countries to streamline vaccine rollout and minimize disparities in vaccine access, ensuring a more equitable and effective global response to the pandemic. Case Study 2: Machine Learning in Predicting Heart Disease Machine learning has shown great promise in improving the early diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which remain a leading cause of death worldwide. In real-world applications, ML models have been used to analyze patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, medical history, and lifestyle factors to predict the risk of heart disease. One such example is the use of ML algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks to assess a patient’s likelihood of developing conditions like heart attacks or strokes. A notable case study involves the Framingham Heart Study, where ML techniques were employed to build predictive models based on decades of health data from participants. These models can identify subtle patterns in patient data that traditional statistical models might miss, enabling early interventions. Moreover, ML is also being used to analyze electrocardiograms (ECGs), medical imaging, and even genetic data to further refine predictions. The result is more personalized and timely treatment plans, improved patient outcomes, and a reduction in healthcare costs by preventing the progression of heart disease through early detection and intervention. These case studies demonstrate the profound impact of ML in both pandemic management and chronic disease prevention, showcasing its ability to transform public health strategies, improve outcomes, and optimize resource allocation.

The gaps highlight areas for further improvement or additional research, which may be helpful for future investigations or improvements in machine learning applications in public health. Addressing Major Gaps in Public Health Using Machine Learning Techniques Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative approach for tackling significant challenges in public health, particularly in predictive analytics, disease management, and resource optimization. One key gap in public health systems is data fragmentation, where information is scattered across multiple platforms, leading to inefficiencies in analysis. To address this, ML methodologies such as federated learning (FL) enable collaborative model training without the need for centralized data sharing. This approach ensures privacy while Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Public Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Approach to Disease Prediction, Prevention and Management SEEJPH Volume XXVI, 2025, ISSN: 2197-5248; Posted:04-01-25 915 | P a g e combining data insights from multiple institutions. For example, in chronic disease management, FL allows healthcare providers to share insights on patient trends without compromising sensitive information, improving the accuracy of predictive models. A second gap is limited interpretability of complex ML models, which undermines their adoption in healthcare workflows. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), are being increasingly integrated into predictive systems. These methods make ML models transparent by identifying key features influencing predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to trust and act on algorithmic outputs. For instance, in cancer prognosis, XAI highlights specific biomarkers influencing survival predictions, helping clinicians make informed treatment decisions. Another significant gap is the inequity in healthcare delivery, where underserved populations lack access to advanced diagnostic tools. Machine learning has been instrumental in developing low-cost, portable diagnostic solutions powered by lightweight neural networks and edge AI. These technologies analyze data from wearable devices and mobile health applications, providing early warnings for conditions like diabetes and hypertension in remote areas. Such innovations bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare, ensuring equitable access to medical interventions. Finally, the lack of real-time outbreak prediction tools has been a persistent issue in public health. ML algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ensemble methods are used to analyze dynamic, real-time data sources, such as social media feeds and environmental sensors, to forecast outbreaks. These tools enable authorities to prepare and allocate resources effectively.

In response to the demand for model interpretability in healthcare as well as other domains, research within the ML community has produced several approaches to explaining models and predictions. While these approaches are discussed in detail in section 2.1.2, the general purpose of an explanation is to answer a particular question a user may have about the model. As a simple example, consider a linear regression model with 100 features. One user may want to know the relationships the model learned between the features and the outcome of interest. For this user, an explanation might consist of the list of weights the model assigned to all 100 features. On the other hand, another user may only want to know why the model made a specific prediction. In this case, 2 an explanation might consist of the 10 features most responsible for the specific prediction. Depending on the question and the user, different explanations about the model may be required. Recently, there has been increased attention to the apparent lack of end-user involvement in the design and evaluation of explanation approaches, despite the acknowledgement that user goals, expertise, and time constraints are central in defining explanation needs.11,12,26–32 The definition of what constitutes a “good” or “useful” explanation is often left to the judgment of novice and expert model developers, whose knowledge and backgrounds are generally not representative of end-user expertise.27,29,33 More specifically, most developers are mainly concerned with the statistical and modeling challenges of generating an explanation; the display of the explanation often receives less attention and is rarely informed by end-user needs or insights from the literature.20,27,31,33 Moreover, it is unclear from current evaluation studies how end-users interpret and utilize explanations designed by modeling experts,12 which often require some level of understanding of ML models to accurately interpret. This may lead to a lack of usability and practical interpretability of these explanations for real end-users. In healthcare, most ML models are proposed as tools to help healthcare providers analyze patient data and derive insights that can assist in clinical decision-making.4,12,29,34 More specifically, ML-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) usually aim to help healthcare providers make more accurate decisions, be more confident in their decisions, and/or be more efficient in making decisions. Explanations for ML models can assist in this process by providing additional information about the model that allows the provider to integrate model information with their knowledge in order to make informed decisions. This implies that explanations must be designed to fit healthcare provider information needs. Unfortunately, there is a sparsity of interpretability evaluation focused on medical applications and most claims regarding model 3 interpretability lack rigorous evaluations utilizing real end-users.28,29,31,32 This makes it difficult to determine when explanations for ML models may be required and how to design these explanations to fit the information needs and environment of healthcare providers. In this dissertation, I aimed to utilize clinician perspectives to inform the design of explanations for ML-based prediction tools. More specifically, I aimed to utilize literature insights to develop a theoretical framework of explanation design that would account for healthcare provider explanation needs when utilizing a predictive model in clinical practice. I then aimed to utilize the framework to suggest possible explanation designs that could be augmented with feedback from healthcare providers to inform the design of a user-centered explanation. 1.1 Hypotheses and Specific Aims I hypothesized that a user-centered explanation design for an ML-based prediction tool would: 1) Improve provider perceptions of utilizing an ML-based prediction tool in clinical practice relative to the same tool without explanations 2) Improve provider accuracy, confidence, and speed in making decisions relative to the same tool without explanations and having no available tool To evaluate this hypothesis, the following specific aims were addressed: Aim 1. Develop a theoretical framework of explanation design and use the framework to suggest explanation designs. Using insights from the literature, develop a theoretical framework of clinical explanation design that accounts for healthcare provider explanation 4 needs when using a model in clinical practice. Then, use the framework to suggest explanation designs. Aim 2. Refine explanation design with healthcare provider feedback. Conduct user studies with healthcare providers to refine explanation needs, identify successful design elements, and inform the final design of a user-centered explanation. Aim 3. Evaluate the impact of the user-centered explanation. Conduct a laboratory study with healthcare providers to assess the impact of the user-centered explanation design on decision-making and perceptions of an ML-based prediction tool. To ground the work in a specific context, I focused on designing and evaluating a user-centered explanation for an in-hospital mortality risk model for pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 1.2 Motivation An ML-based CDSS can only be successful if healthcare providers accept and use the system.35–37 System acceptance and use will likely be determined by some combination of contextual factors and design factors. To understand how a user-centered explanation may influence successful implementation of an ML-based CDSS, it is necessary to understand the specific factors that might influence system acceptance and use. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)38 provides one possible approach to understanding such factors. The UTAUT is a validated theory of technology adoption and use that has been shown to explain some of the variance in the use of health information systems.39 The theory, shown graphically in Figure 1, identifies performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions as the four key constructs that determine user acceptance and usage behavior either 5 directly or as determinants of the behavioral intention to use a technology. Gender, age, experience and voluntariness of user are included as moderators of the impact of the four key constructs on usage intention and behavior. By examining how explanation design may affect key UTAUT constructs, one can obtain a better understanding of the potential role user-centered explanations may play in healthcare provider acceptance and use of an ML-based CDSS in practice. The goal in this work was to look at design issues that may impact performance expectancy and effort expectancy, as the social influence and facilitating conditions constructs would be challenging to control. These constructs deal with an individual’s perceptions of how the specific social environment and organizational infrastructure promotes the use of a system, which makes it difficult to theorize how explanations might affect these constructs. Figure 1. Graphic depiction of how explanation design may impact key constructs in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). White boxes and solid line arrows depict the main constructs and modifiers that comprise the UTAUT theory. The grey ovals indicate the proposed extensions to the UTAUT model to demonstrate the potential impact of explanation design on key constructs. The exentions are connected to their main constructs using dashed arrows. (Adapted from Venkatesh et al.38) 6 Figure 1 depicts how an explanation design may affect the remaining two constructs, performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Performance expectancy refers to an individual’s perceptions of how a system might improve or detract from his/her ability to do his/her job, while effort expectancy refers to an individual’s perceptions of the degree of effort involved in understanding and using a system.38 These perceptions can be directly influenced by the degree to which explanation designs for ML-based CDSS fit healthcare providers’ information needs and environment. For example, how well an explanation design fits a healthcare provider’s information needs likely affects the degree to which a healthcare provider can understand the information being provided by the ML-based CDSS. This directly affects whether healthcare providers can integrate the system knowledge with their own in order to make informed decisions, which can affect provider perceptions of the effort required to use the system (effort expectancy) and the utility of the system to improve their job (performance expectancy). Additionally, the degree to which explanation design fits the environment in which an ML-based CDSS is being used likely affects the time and cognitive resources required to understand the information being provided by the system. Demands on time and cognitive resources will also likely affect provider perceptions of the effort required to use the system (effort expectancy) and the utility of the system to improve their job (performance expectancy). Thus, the degree to which explanation designs for ML-based CDSS fit healthcare providers’ information needs and environment may influence perceptions of the performance expectancy and effort expectancy of the system, both of which influence the behavioral intention to use the system. Based on the UTAUT constructs and the proposed extensions, it appears that user-centered explanations for ML-based CDSS could play an important role in healthcare provider acceptance and use of the system in practice. This suggests that employing user-centered approaches to 7 explanation design would be beneficial. Researchers in the human computer interaction (HCI) and ML communities have proposed frameworks for and provided guidance on user-centered explanation design for systems based on ML models and other artificial intelligence (AI) approaches.20,40–44 When discussing the design of explanations, this body of literature focuses mainly on who an explanation is provided to, or the user of the system, and why the user requires an explanation, or the specific goals the user is trying to accomplish.40,42,44 These are important elements in understanding the context of use of an explanation, yet little attention seems to be paid to where or when users require explanations. These additional questions relate to the environment in which a user is expected to use an explanation, which has been demonstrated to be an important consideration when designing explanations for ML-based CDSS. Thus, it appears that current frameworks for user-centered explanation design do not properly account for healthcare provider explanation needs when utilizing a predictive model in clinical practice. 1.3 Approach Combining insights from and expanding upon prior theory-informed frameworks for user-centered explanation design, I proposed a new framework for designing user-centered explanations for ML-based systems for healthcare in which explanation design is informed by the entire context of use. Specifically, I proposed that user-centered explanation design in healthcare should not only consider who an explanation is being provided to and why they desire that explanation, but also when and where that explanation will be used (i.e., the environment of use). The proposed framework supports explanation design by linking the components of the context of use (who, why, when, where) to explanation design choices such as what information the explanation needs to 8 contain (i.e., the content) and how that information needs to be provided (i.e., the presentation). I subsequently demonstrated an application of the framework by designing and evaluating explanations for a pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. More specifically, I used literature insights to define the context of use for the prediction tool and suggest possible explanation designs. Feedback from healthcare providers was then used to refine the defined context of use and inform the final design of a user-centered explanation. The impact of the user-centered explanation on healthcare provider decision-making and perceptions of the prediction tool was then evaluated in a laboratory study. 1.4 Significance and Innovation To the best of my knowledge, this is the first proposed framework for user-centered explanation design for ML-based systems that provides specific guidance on design choices based on the entire context of use of the explanation. While the framework was developed and applied with a focus on explaining ML-based systems in healthcare, it is generalizable to other domains as well. This work also provides meaningful contributions to the discussion on the importance of model interpretability in healthcare. As mentioned previously, several papers have pointed out lack of model interpretability as a barrier to the adoption of ML models in practical clinical applications.3,5,6,8,10–12 However, a lack of model interpretability is not the only possible barrier to adoption. Other work has identified barriers that relate to model utility, such as a poor match between model information and clinical information needs (e.g., models that don’t predict events of clinical relevance or that do not provide actionable information).45,46 While model 9 interpretability may improve model utility (e.g., providing information that leads to actionable insights), it is unclear how the relationship between these two concepts may influence the adoption of a predictive model in practice. Moreover, it is unclear if one concept might play a more influential role in adoption. Healthcare provider assessments are needed to identify which specific factors related to interpretability and utility might prevent an ML model from being used in practice. This study is among the few that have evaluated predictive model explanations using healthcare providers, and sheds light on how user-centered explanation designs enable healthcare providers to understand an ML model in a meaningful way. Findings from this work help partially elucidate factors related to interpretability and utility that may impact the acceptance and use of ML-based tools in practice. Finally, this work contributes to knowledge on how to communicate model predictions, specifically those based on complex ML models, to healthcare providers in a manner that facilitates their involvement in conversations about the development, deployment, and continuous improvement of predictive models for use in clinical practice. These conversations help ensure the development of ML-based systems that deliver information when and where it is needed in a way that is useful to providers and which may promote positive changes in clinical practice. 1.5 Dissertation Overview In Chapter 2, I present an overview of the literature on interpretability, review current frameworks and guidance on user-centered explanation design for AI systems, and discuss prior work on interpretability in healthcare. Chapter 3 presents the new proposed framework for user-centered explanation design for ML-based systems in healthcare, while Chapters 4, 5, and 6 10 demonstrate an application of the framework. Chapter 4 demonstrates how the proposed framework was used in conjunction with literature insights to define a context of use for an ML-based prediction tool and suggest possible user-centered explanation designs. Chapter 5 describes the user studies conducted with healthcare providers to refine the context of use and explanation designs to develop a final, user-centered explanation design for the ML-based prediction tool. Chapter 6 presents an evaluation of the impact of the user-centered explanation design on healthcare provider decision-making and perceptions of the ML-based prediction tool. Finally, Chapter 7 includes a discussion of the work completed, identifies limitations, suggests directions for future work, and presents final conclusions. 11 2.0 Background This chapter provides a review of the literature relevant to this dissertation. Section 2.1 provides an overview of the literature on interpretability, including how the concept is defined and its relationship to explanation, approaches to achieving interpretability, and approaches to evaluating interpretability. Section 2.2 summarizes available frameworks and guidance for user-centered explanation design and evaluation. Section 2.3 concludes the chapter with an overview of the role of interpretability in healthcare and summarizes prior work in the area. 2.1 Landscape of Interpretability Interpretability is a multi-dimensional concept that is closely related to the concept of explanation. The reviewed literature lacks consistent terminology and definitions for these terms, which can make interpretation challenging. Figure 2 provides an overview of the concept of interpretability as viewed in this dissertation and serves as a visual guide for the concepts discussed in sections 2.1.1-2.1.2. 12 Figure 2. Landscape of interpretability. A roadmap for understanding the multi-dimensional nature of the concept of interpretability. Alternative terms commonly used in the literature are bolded and in quotes. 2.1.1 Defining Interpretability and Explanation Current literature lacks a concrete definition for the term “interpretability”11,30,43,47–50; however, the demand for interpretability appears to arise when the goals of real world deployment require a system to satisfy evaluation criteria that are hard to formulize or quantify as part of the problem formulation of a system.28,43,47 Examples of such criteria are defined in Table 1. These evaluation criteria are often interrelated and usually require subjective assessment by humans to determine if they are met. Thus, when users demand interpretability, they are often seeking some sort of explanation about a model or a system to assist them in evaluating whether certain criteria are satisfied. This close relationship between the concepts of interpretability and explanation often results in the term “explainability” being used interchangeably with “interpretability”.11,28,47,51 Interpretability generally takes the form of an explanation, but what defines an explanation and 13 what constitutes a quality explanation are topics still widely debated within both the ML and social science literature.27,43,52,53 Table 1. Examples of evaluation criteria that promote a demand for interpretability Criteria Definition Fairness & Bias Reduction6,31,43,47,49 Ensuring that protected groups are not discriminated against Adherence to ethical principles6,47 Ensuring that algorithm decisions or suggestions conform to ethical standards Privacy6,43 Protecting sensitive information Accountability & Liability6,31,54–56 Assigning responsibility of a suggestion or decision to an algorithm Transferability, Reliability, & Robustness26,43,47 Ensuring algorithms exhibit certain levels of performance when applied in unfamiliar situations Informativeness31,47 Providing useful information for real-world decision-making or accomplishing a task Safety28 Protecting against danger, risk, or injury caused by decisions or suggestions of a system Justifiability11,21 Ensuring a model aligns with existing domain knowledge A basic definition of an explanation adopted in the ML literature is the concept of an ‘everyday explanation’, which is defined by Miller27 as an answer to a why-question. Gilpin et al.52 notes that this formulation of the concept of explanation is particularly interesting in ML because “when you can phrase what you want to know from an algorithm as why questions, there is a natural qualitative representation of when you have answered said question—when you can no longer keep asking why”. Under this view, it can be said that the demand for interpretability is met when the ML system has provided satisfactory explanations for all questions put forth by the users of the ML system. The specific questions asked and explanations expected will depend on a user’s individual relationship to the system,56 and no single explanation is likely to satisfy all users. The differing goals, expertise (e.g., background knowledge, experiences), and time constraints of users play a central role in determining the appropriate explanation that answers a question.12,26,43,51,52,56 Researchers have noted the challenge of producing appropriate explanations to various users while also providing an accurate explanation of the underlying ML system 14 processes.11,12,26,52,56,57 Gilpin et al.52 describe this issue by proposing to view explanations as having properties of comprehensibility1 and completeness. The comprehensibility of an explanation refers to its ability to describe a system in a way that is understandable to humans and relies on producing system descriptions that respect the cognition, knowledge, and biases of the user. In other words, the explanation must produce system descriptions that are “simple enough for a person to understand using a vocabulary that is meaningful to the user”.52 The completeness of an explanation is its ability to describe the operations of a system in an accurate way. These are often conflicting goals. For example, an explanation that achieves perfect completeness may use highly technical language and be complex, which would likely result in low comprehensibility. Thus, the challenge in producing explanations for ML systems lies in appropriately balancing the tradeoff between comprehensibility and completeness. This balance will be heavily influenced by the user to whom the explanation is being provided and the context in which it must be provided. When an explanation of an ML system must provide a higher level of comprehensibility, terms like “intelligibility”, “comprehensibility”, and “understandability” are often used synonymously with “interpretability”.11,47,58 When an explanation of an ML system must provide a higher level of completeness, the term “transparency” is often used interchangeably with “interpretability”.47,58 2.1.1.1 Levels and Types of Explanation In recognition of the challenge of providing explanations for ML systems that appropriately balance comprehensibility and completeness, the literature has defined several “levels” or “types” of explanation for ML models. Some researchers refer to these as levels or types of interpretability, 1Gilpin et al.52 originally used the term “interpretability”, but I have chosen to use “comprehensibility” to avoid ambiguity with my previous discussion of the concept of interpretability 15 but as interpretability generally takes the form of an explanation, I will consistently use the term explanation to describe approaches to interpretability throughout this work. Although the terminology differs, many researchers have chosen to distinguish types of explanations based on whether they describe model processes or behavior.12,20,32,47,48,52,54,57,59 Explanations of processes focus on elucidating aspects of the model training algorithm, parameter settings, and/or internal representation/structure (i.e., the mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs).47,48 These are referred to as “transparent”, “white-box”, or “descriptive” explanations, as they typically provide detailed descriptions of the internal operations of a model.47,48,54,57,59 These explanations can provide insights into why an ML system may dysfunction, or fail to operate as intended, and are most useful in the context of debugging, monitoring, and improving systems.20 Thus, these explanations tend to prioritize completeness, at the possible risk of lower comprehensibility. Explanations of behavior generally focus on clarifying how a model relates inputs to outputs,32,54,59 and may involve showing the influence of each input, revealing characteristics of similarly classified instances, and/or changes in inputs that would result in a change in output.55 These may be referred to as “black box explanations”, ”observations”, “justifications”, or “persuasive explanations” as they offer reasons for a model’s outputs, but generally do not contain information regarding the internal operations of the model.32,48,54,57,59 These explanations can provide insights into why a system may misfunction, or produce unintended or undesired effects, and are typically most useful in ensuring that a system meets various evaluation criteria such as unbiasedness, justifiability, etc.20 Thus, these explanations tend to have higher comprehensibility, but lower completeness; however, it should be noted that in some cases, an explanation of model processes may be requested if an explanation of model behavior does not satisfy a user’s information needs.59 16 Researchers have also distinguished between explanations provided at the global and local/instance levels of models, with these terms being used consistently throughout the literature.12,15,26,43,51,56,60–62 According to Adadi and Berrada,51 an explanation for a model at the global level “facilitates the understanding of the whole logic of a model and follows the entire reasoning leading to all the different possible outcomes”. More generally, the goal of global-level explanations is to help users develop mental models of a model and how it works. These explanations can include information regarding the training information, the architecture and algorithms, the functional-level performance descriptions (e.g., accuracy), and boundary conditions and failure modes, i.e., information on what the model cannot do or does not perform well on.61 These explanations tend to have high completeness, but it is generally challenging to improve the comprehensibility of these explanations. An explanation for a model at the local level provides the reasoning behind a specific model output or group of outputs.51,62 This is also sometimes referred to as the instance level, which is the term adopted in this work. While instance-level explanations are also aimed at helping users gain mental models of the system, they focus on helping a user understand and interpret specific model outputs.61 These explanations can achieve high levels of comprehensibility, but generally lack completeness. Both global- and instance-level explanations can be aimed at explaining either model processes or behavior, although typically global-level explanations describe model processes and instance-level explanations describe model behavior. Hall et al.15 suggest that the best explanations for ML models will likely come from a combination of both instance- and global-level explanations. 17 2.1.2 Interpretability Approaches As mentioned previously, I view approaches to interpretability as forms of explanation and thus consistently use the term explanation in reviewing the literature. However, it should be noted that outside of this work the term interpretability is used more frequently when describing and classifying various approaches. Although multiple prior attempts have used differing terminology to classify approaches to explanation,15,20,26,28,47,51,52,62,63 it is generally agreed that there are at least two main categories of explanation approaches: integrated and post-hoc.20,28,65,31,47,50,51,56,62–64 In the sub-sections below, I define each category and provide further sub-categories of approaches. I provide general descriptions of the various sub-categories and only give examples as is necessary to distinguish between the categories. For more examples of approaches, I recommend referring to one of the several literature reviews/surveys available.26,28,51,52,63 It should be noted that many of the approaches in these categories make claims of interpretability that are not substantiated by empirical user studies. 2.1.2.1 Integrated Explanation Approaches Following Došilović et al.,28 I define integrated explanation approaches as those approaches that are transparency-based—that is, they are aimed at describing model processes and are generated as part of the learning/training process. These approaches generally provide global-level explanations. Combining insights from Došilović et al.28 and Gilpin et al.,52 I sub-divide these approaches into pure transparent, hybrid, and explanation-producing approaches. In pure transparent approaches to explanation, the family of models that can be used is restricted to those that are considered transparent, or models whose internal mechanisms can be understood.28,47 Typical examples of such model families include decision trees, Naïve Bayes 18 models, logistic regressions, and linear regressions, among others. The model itself can serve as an explanation and may be referred to as an “intrinsically interpretable model”, “inherently interpretable model”, “intelligible model”, “comprehensible model”, “transparent model”, “transparent-box model”, “white-box model”, or “glass-box model”.26,29,51,56,66 Pure transparent approaches will generate explanations that have high completeness, but the level of comprehensibility will depend on the complexity of the model. It is generally accepted that for pure transparent approaches, accuracy comes at the cost of comprehensibility.51 For example, a linear regression model using hundreds of features or highly engineered features may exhibit high accuracy, but the complexity of the model leads to decreased comprehensibility. In hybrid approaches, transparent model families are paired with models whose internal mechanisms are generally considered to be opaque, i.e., “black-box” models, to produce models that sacrifice some comprehensibility to achieve better accuracy.28 Again, the model itself typically serves as the explanation in these types of approaches. An example of a hybrid approach from Došilović et al.28 combined logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) approaches to credit scoring. In explanation-producing approaches, models that are considered to be “black-boxes” are specifically built to provide explanations that improve the transparency of their internal mechanisms.52 These approaches typically apply to neural networks, such as those that learn disentangled representations,52 and the balance between completeness and comprehensibility will vary by approach. 2.1.2.2 Post-hoc Explanation Approaches Post-hoc explanation approaches involve separating the tasks of model learning and explanation, i.e., applying explanation methods after the model learning/training process.51,62 These approaches are sometimes referred to as “reverse engineering” approaches to explanation 19 as they involve a level of model reconstruction.26,51 These explanations may be in the form of visualizations, natural language or text, rules, examples, and various other formats.20,47,51 Post-hoc explanation approaches can be sub-divided into model-specific and model-agnostic approaches.15,28,51,62,65 Model-specific explanation approaches are only applicable to specific models as they rely on idiosyncrasies of the model’s internal mechanisms.28,51,62 These explanations can aim to describe model processes and/or behavior and can be provided for both the instance- and global- levels, although global-level explanations tend to be more common. Thus, the level of comprehensibility and completeness of a model-specific post-hoc explanation will vary by approach. It should be noted that all integrated explanation approaches mentioned in section 2.1.2.1 are also model-specific, but they are not post-hoc. An example of a model-specific post-hoc explanation approach is given by Barakat et al.,25 who used model-specific techniques to extract rule-based explanations from an SVM classifier for predicting diabetes. Model-agnostic explanation approaches are not tied to any specific model or algorithm, i.e., they treat the original model as a “black-box”.28,51,62,64 They generally operate by analyzing only the inputs and outputs of the original model and thus describe model behavior.28,62,64 The model-agnostic approaches can be provided at both the global- and instance-levels, although instance-level explanations are more commonly seen. These approaches tend to produce explanations with lower completeness than other explanation approaches; however, they can typically provide high comprehensibility and offer the attractive advantage of being generalizable. More specifically, model-agnostic post-hoc explanation approaches provide general explanation formats that allow for customization to fit user information needs, enable comparisons of different models, and facilitate the process of switching out a model in a deployed ML system.64 Model- 20 agnostic post-hoc explanation approaches can be loosely grouped by the technique used to generate the explanation: 1) visualizations (e.g., partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation), 2) knowledge extraction (e.g., rule-extraction, model distillation), 3) feature influence methods (e.g., sensitivity analysis, feature importance/attribution), and 4) example-based (e.g., prototypes and criticisms, counterfactual explanations).51 2.1.3 Evaluating Interpretability Approaches As what constitutes a good explanation for an ML model is both user- and context-dependent, it is unsurprising that the literature provides no standard approach to evaluating model explanations that claim to facilitate interpretability. Doshi-Velez and Kim43 have posited that the evaluation of approaches to interpretability should match the claimed contribution. For example, if the aim of an explanation approach is to make a model useful in some context or application, then the explanations should be evaluated with respect to that application (e.g., explanations for a model to assist in medical diagnosis should be evaluated by having doctors use the system to make diagnoses). They proposed a simple 3-level taxonomy for approaches to interpretability evaluation: 1) application-grounded, 2) human-grounded, and 3) functionally-grounded. These general categorizations provide a useful framework for discussing general approaches to evaluating interpretability. Figure 3 provides an overview of each approach, which are discussed in detail in the next few paragraphs. In this section I discuss only general approaches to evaluating interpretability and I discuss specific studies evaluating interpretability within the healthcare domain in section 2.3.2. 21 Figure 3. General approaches to interpretability evaluation (adapted from Doshi-Velez and Kim43). A summary of the three general approaches to interpretability evaluation with example experiments for each approach. Approaches are distinguished by the type of experimental tasks and subjects involved, and get more costly as the level of user-involvement and experimental complexity increases. Application-grounded approaches involve experiments in which real humans, i.e., target end-users, use real applications to perform the intended end-task of the application. This allows for the evaluation of explanation quality within the context of its intended use. The suggested baseline for these types of evaluations is how well human-produced explanations assist in other humans completing the task (i.e., the gold standard is the success rate of completing the task using explanations provided by humans). These approaches are centered on the idea that if a system that employs an explanation approach has practical utility, then the explanations must satisfy the demand for interpretability. It should be noted that these are the most demanding evaluations to perform, requiring significant time, effort, and expense to complete.43 Thus, few evaluations of interpretability employ an application-grounded approach, but some can be seen in the literature on explanations for recommender systems.67 Human-grounded approaches involve experiments in which real humans use explanations to perform simplified tasks that maintain the essence of the target application. These types of 22 experiments aim to test general notions of explanation quality and can usually be performed with lay users when experiments with target end-users prove logistically challenging (e.g., highly trained domain experts pose logistical challenges as they generally have smaller recruitment pools and higher compensation requirements).43 As these approaches are typically simpler to employ than application-grounded approaches, they are the most commonly used in the interpretability evaluation literature when humans are involved. Simulatability experiments, i.e., does the explanation approach allow a human to easily predict a model’s output for a given input, are quite popular in the literature.20,32,56 The general motivation for this measure is that if an explanation approach has allowed a human to build a robust, accurate understanding of a model, then they should be able to simulate the model’s behavior. Other common human-grounded approaches in the literature can be loosely categorized as model evaluation experiments (e.g., impact on ability to identify model errors and/or select best model), effectiveness experiments (e.g., impact on user ability to make decisions with the model), confidence/trust experiments (e.g., change in user prediction before and after seeing the model prediction), and preference experiments (e.g., user rates the quality of different explanation formats).20,67,68 Efficiency experiments, i.e., measuring how long it takes a user to comprehend different explanations or perform tasks using explanations, are also human-grounded approaches, but are rarely seen in the literature.26,67 Functionally-grounded approaches involve no human experiments, and instead use some formal definition of interpretability as a proxy of explanation quality. An example of a possible proxy would be a family of models whose interpretability has been validated in human experiments (e.g., decision trees have been validated in some contexts).43 Researchers can optimize the performance of an approach based on that proxy and use the proxy to substantiate their claims for interpretability (e.g., optimizing the performance of decision trees on some task could claim to be 23 an interpretable approach). Much of the literature on interpretability appears to take this approach to justify claims for interpretability, but it is debatable whether the current suggested proxies are appropriate. For example, many methods claim interpretability by adopting pure transparent or hybrid approaches to explanation and then using model size as a measure for explanation complexity.26,43 These approaches suggest that the size and transparency of a model can serve as proxies of explanation quality. However, studies have found that end-user preferences for smaller or larger models is context-dependent, and the comprehensibility of various model families depends on the end-user (e.g., an end-user with no statistical background may not find a sparse linear regression comprehensible).29,69 Thus, a small transparent model will not always be an appropriate proxy for explanation quality. Another proxy for explanation quality sometimes seen in the literature is agreement with knowledge about the underlying model and/or the domain problem, i.e., if the explanation seems reasonable according to modeling and/or domain experts.52 This typically involves a few experts reviewing explanations, but is a far more informal and small-scale evaluation than a human-grounded approach and is perhaps one of the weakest approaches for evaluating interpretability. The general challenge in functionally-grounded approaches lies in identifying appropriate proxies for explanation quality, particularly because there are limited studies on user-based measures of interpretability and relevant concepts such as comprehensibility are difficult to quantify.11,28,43,68 2.2 User-centered Explanation Design and Evaluation for AI Systems This section provides an overview of the relevant literature on user-centered explanation design and evaluation for AI systems. This section is not meant to serve as a comprehensive review 24 of the literature, and instead focuses on summarizing some existing design and evaluation frameworks and their limitations. A summary of guidance on user-centered explanation design and evaluation that is relevant to the proposed framework is also provided. A framework proposed by Wang et al.40 relies on theories of human reasoning and explanation, and highlights specific elements of AI explanation that support these processes and mitigate errors. The framework is shown graphically with a brief description in Figure 4. The framework promotes explanation design by linking specific AI explanation techniques and elements to the human cognitive processes and patterns they can support (e.g., “what if” type explanations support counterfactual reasoning; information about the prior probability can help mitigate confirmation bias). In a follow up position paper,41 the researchers used the framework to theoretically justify the use of specific explanation types to support various user goals based on how users may generally reason about the goal. For example, a user trying to identify a specific cause for a particular system outcome might employ contrastive reasoning, which can be supported by “why not” type explanations that provide information about why an alternative system outcome was not produced. Although some examples are provided, the authors provide limited guidance on how to connect reasoning processes to specific AI elements and techniques. The framework also does not consider the specific type of user when considering goals and cognitive processes and it does not account for the environment in which an explanation is being provided. Moreover, the framework links reasoning processes to a non-comprehensive list of AI explanation elements and techniques that currently exist, which provides limited guidance on how user reasoning can inform the design of new displays for existing explanation algorithms as well as for new explanation algorithms. 25 Figure 4. Conceptual framework for reasoned explanations that describes how human reasoning processes (left) inform explainable AI techniques (right) from Wang et al.40 “Points describe different theories of reasoning, explainable AI techniques, and strategies for designing explainable AI. Arrows indicate pathway connections: red arrows for how theories of human reasoning inform explainable AI features, and grey for inter-relations between different reasoning processes and associations between explainable AI features. Only some example pathways are shown. For example, hypothetico-deductive reasoning can be interfered by System 1 thinking and cause confirmation bias (grey arrow). Confirmation bias can be mitigated (follow the red line) by presenting information about the prior probability or input attributions. Next, we can see that input attributions can be implemented as lists and visualized using tornado plots (follow the grey line).” (Image and caption taken directly from Wang et al.40) A framework proposed by Ribera and Lapedriza42 is based on theories that describe explanation as a social interaction. The framework is shown graphically with a brief description in Figure 5. Their framework focuses on understanding the explainee (i.e., the user) needs and providing explanations that both meet those needs and follow Grice’s maxims of conversation70 (quantity, quality, relation, manner—in short, only be as informative as needed, be truthful, be 26 relevant, and be perspicuous). The framework describes three general user types based on their background and relationship to the AI system: 1) AI experts—researchers who develop an AI system, 2) domain experts—specialists in the area in which the system is being used (e.g., physicians, lawyers, etc.), and 3) lay users—the recipients of the final decisions of the system (e.g., a patient that has been diagnosed). They combine these user types with Grice’s maxims to identify specific explanation goals (why), the content to include in an explanation (what), the type of explanation or explanation approach (how), and suitable evaluation approaches for each user type. Although the proposed framework helps elucidate general explanation design ideas to support the goals for each user type, it includes only a select set of the available concepts on explanation design available in the model interpretability literature and it does not consider the environment in which the explanation is being provided to a user. Additionally, the framework is difficult to utilize when the user types overlap (e.g., a lay-user who is also a domain expert). Figure 5. User-centric framework based on Grice’s conversation maxims from Ribera and Lapedriza.42 “The system targets explanations to different types of user, taking into account their different goals, and providing relevant (Grice’s 3rd maxim) and customized information to them (Grice’s 2nd and 4th maxim). Evaluation methods are tailored to each explanation.” (Image and caption taken directly from Ribera and Lapedriza42) 27 Mohseni et al.44 reviewed existing literature on explainable AI from a variety of domains to develop a general framework for the design and evaluation of explainable AI systems that considers the type of users and their primary goals and needs. The authors identify three user types similar to the three types proposed by Ribera and Lapedriza42: 1) AI novices, or end-users of AI products that have limited knowledge of ML, 2) data experts, or data scientists and domain experts who use ML approaches but generally lack in-depth expertise, and 3) ML experts, who design and have a strong theoretical understanding of ML algorithms. The authors suggest designing explanations by identifying the intended user of an explainable AI application, choosing an AI application that meets the targeted user’s primary goals and needs, choosing the explanation type and format that supports the user type and intended application, and finally performing user-evaluations of the explanations. Mohseni et al.44 expand upon this suggested approach by proposing a three-level nested model to design and evaluate an explainable AI system, where each level builds upon the work of previous levels. Figure 6 depicts and briefly describes the model. Figure 6. Three-level nested model to designing and evaluating an explainable AI system from Mohseni et al.44 ”The innermost layer (Red) presents design and evaluation of interpretable ML algorithms. The middle layer (Blue) shows design and evaluates human understandable explanations and explainable intelligent interfaces and agents. The outer layer (Green) demonstrates evaluation of explainable AI system outcomes with end-users.” (Image and caption taken directly from Mohseni et al.44) 28 The goal at the lowest level (Interpretable Models Level) is to design understandable models, which usually involves ML experts who want to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of an explanation method, usually utilizing computational measures such as comparison to an interpretable model. The goal of the middle level (Explanation Interpretability Level) is to design understandable explanations that satisfy target user usability needs, which usually involves subjective evaluations of target user satisfaction with and understanding of the system. The goal at the highest level (Explainable AI System Outcomes Level) is to evaluate the ability of the explainable AI system to satisfy target-user needs, which usually involves domain-specific subjective and objective measures of the system impact on user task performance and perceptions of the system. These three levels and proposed evaluation metrics closely align with the functionally-grounded, human-grounded, and application-grounded approaches to evaluating interpretability proposed by Doshi-Velez and Kim,43 respectively. While this proposed framework is useful when discussing the big picture of user-centered design and evaluation of explainable AI systems, it provides limited guidance on explanation designs that could support user needs at each of the three levels. In addition to the previously mentioned frameworks, a few other authors have provided useful insights that can guide user-centered explanation design and evaluation. Ras et al.20 offer a categorization of users of ML systems that further expands upon the general user types proposed by Ribera and Lapedriza42 and Mohseni et al.44 The authors define two broad categories of users based on expertise: 1) expert users who are responsible for implementing an ML system and who typically have some knowledge about the inner workings of an ML system, and 2) lay users who are the people for which an ML system is built and who are not expected to have knowledge about the inner workings of an ML system. The two categories are further sub-divided into specific types 29 of users, which loosely represent the various relationships a user may have with an AI system. For each categorization, Ras et al.20 identify possible goals and concerns that may prompt the user to ask for explanations. These goals and concerns fall under Samek et al.’s71 four broad categories of reasons why users seek explanations of AI systems: 1) verification, 2) improvement, 3) learning, and 4) compliance. Verification includes examining how decisions/suggestions are made by the system to ensure it is operating as expected. Improvement can be closely tied to verification and covers activities related to improving the system performance and efficiency. Learning refers to any activity where the user seeks to extract knowledge from the system. Compliance is also closely tied to verification and relates to any activities aimed at ensuring the system adheres to an established legal, moral, or other societal standard. Table 2 combines the insights from Ras et al.20 and Samek et al.71 to provide definitions and possible explanation goals for different user categories, which are not intended to be mutually exclusive (i.e., a user may belong to more than one category). Other insights that can guide user-centered explanation design and evaluation come from the previously discussed work on interpretability evaluation by Doshi-Velez and Kim.43 The authors hypothesize several factors that may influence user explanation needs, highlighting the importance of considering user expertise and environmental factors (e.g., time constraints) when completing a task. Additionally, the authors define cognitive chunks as the basic units of explanation, and suggest that the form, number, level of compositionality (i.e., how chunks are organized), and relationship (e.g., combination of chunks in linear or nonlinear way) of these chunks may differ based on user explanations. These concepts demonstrate more general design considerations than those introduced in the framework by Wang et al.,40 yet more specific than those suggested by Ribera and Lapedriza.42 30 Table 2. Categories of users and explanation goals (adapted from Ras et al.20 and Samek et al.71) Main Category Sub-category Description and Concerns Explanation Goals Expert user Engineer  Have detailed knowledge about mathematical theories and principles behind a system  Concerned with developing and improving ML algorithms/models  Verification E.g., debugging models  Improvement E.g., identifying ways to improve existing models Developer  Focus on building ML systems for lay people  Often utilize off-the-shelf ML algorithms  Concerned with satisfying various use cases of the ML system  Verification E.g., model behavior alignment with use case criteria  Improvement E.g., hyperparameter tuning Lay user Owners  Acquire ML system for use  Individuals and organizations  Concerned with evaluating capabilities of system  Verification E.g., justification of predictions, malfunction rate  Compliance E.g., liability/safety concerns End-users  Individuals expected to use the ML system as part of personal and/or professional activities  Concerned with understanding capabilities of system  Verification E.g., justification of prediction, reliability concerns  Learning E.g., actionable outcomes, assistance in completing task Data subjects  Individuals or entities whose information is being processed or who are otherwise directly affected by the ML system  Concerned with system impact on self  Compliance E.g., adherence to ethical principles, privacy concerns Stakeholders  Other individuals or organizations who claim an interest in the ML system, but are not directly connected to its development, use, or outcome  Concerned with system impact in general  Compliance E.g., adherence to ethical principles, liability concerns 2.3 Interpretability in Healthcare 2.3.1 Motivations for Interpretability The high stakes and complex nature of healthcare motivates ML-based applications which assist healthcare providers in achieving various goals.12 Thus, much of the literature motivates the need for model interpretability in healthcare by claiming that it is integral to the usability, 31 acceptability, and trustworthiness of an ML model.6–8,10–12,29 Although these motivations are somewhat vague, most are linked to real-world goals in which criteria such as informativeness, accountability, liability, justifiability, etc. must be satisfied. The most common goal for a provider utilizing an ML model is to provide better and more effective care for a patient.12 In most cases, ML models are proposed as a tools to help providers analyze patient data and derive insights that can guide clinical decision-making.4,12,29,34 Effective use of an ML model in practice requires a healthcare provider to assimilate knowledge from the model and reconcile it with prior knowledge and missing contextual information to make informed care decisions. As clinical decisions made with the assistance of an ML model may affect the lives of patients, it is essential that providers be able to validate the information provided by the model.4,8,34,51 Moreover, healthcare practitioners are legally and ethically responsible for any care decisions made based on ML model information, and will therefore be unlikely to adopt or deploy ML models that cannot justify their outputs or be vetted for potentially critical errors or data bias.6,8,11,12,21,29,34 Thus, when ML models are used to assist in providing patient care, interpretability may be demanded to allow providers to derive actionable insights from the model, verify model outputs before acting on them, and defend care decisions based on the ML model. The demand for model interpretability may also present itself even when ML models are not used directly in clinical practice. For example, it is generally accepted that ML models can be improved by integrating knowledge and feedback from domain experts into the learning/development process.6,7,72 Model interpretability approaches can serve as tools that facilitate conversations between healthcare providers and model developers. These conversations could lead to improved models for use in healthcare. Alternatively, ML models may be used in healthcare as data-driven approaches to generating new knowledge that could help advance the 32 field.7,12,34 By uncovering correlations between patient characteristics and outcomes of interest, ML approaches to predictive modeling can assist domain experts in causal reasoning and hypothesis generation.34,69,73 In this case, the explanation of a model should assist domain experts in identifying new predictively accurate explanatory variables to study,7,73 potentially leading to new therapies and interventions that lead to improved outcomes and lower costs.34 2.3.2 Explanation Approaches and Evaluations There has been a recent surge in publications of high-performing models for healthcare applications that also make a claim of interpretability (Figure 7). Table 3 uses the terms introduced in section 2.1 to summarize some of the interpretability approaches seen in this recent set of work. This table only captures a subset of the relevant literature, but it does offer insight as to model interpretability research from the ML community that has been used in healthcare applications. Figure 7. SCOPUS publications on model interpretability in healthcare from 2008-2018. Aggregate numbers were generated using the search query ((TITLE-ABS-KEY((""predictive model"" OR ""artificial intelligence"" OR ""machine learning"") AND (""healthcare"" OR ""medicine"") AND (""transparent” OR “intelligible” OR “explainable” OR “explanation” OR “interpretable” OR “comprehensible” OR “understandable”))). The query was run on November 29, 2018. 33 Table 3 shows that researchers have recently begun to explore alternative approaches to interpretability other than the use of logistic regression and other comprehensible models. However, human evaluations with end-users are rarely performed. Such studies are particularly important in healthcare, where providers are already overwhelmed by vast amounts of data. It is vital that ML models and explanations be delivered in a manner that does not exacerbate this problem.6,12 Additionally, the intended user should be satisfied with the information provided.6,12 Based on the literature survey, no human-evaluation studies of model explanations in healthcare have fully addressed these issues. Krause et al.74 performed a human evaluation of a custom visual explanation approach, but the target end-users of their system were data scientists/analysts and not healthcare providers. Lundberg et al.75 performed a small-scale study to evaluate whether explanations for predictions improved anesthesiologists’ ability to predict hypoxemia risk during surgery, but did not assess provider perceptions of satisfaction with the system and explanations.

The framework was inspired by the frameworks of Wang et al.40 and Ribera and Laprediza42 and incorporates other guidance on user-centered explanation design for AI systems. The purpose of this framework is to propose a general approach to user-centered explanation design that can be applied to the adoption of existing explanation approaches and to the development of new approaches. Therefore, specific design suggestions (e.g., a specific explanation approach or presentation method) are not included and the examples provided are not meant to be comprehensive. However, the examples provided in the framework encompass many of the ideas that appear in the literature on interpretability and user-centered explanation design and evaluation. Prior to presenting the framework, it is important to clarify its scope and limitations. The proposed framework was developed to design explanations for empirically-based predictive models, or data-driven models based on statistical associations that aim to minimize prediction error.73 It is not intended to be used for explanatory models, or theory-driven models that aim to test causal relationships between variables and that may be used in prediction tasks. A more in depth discussion on the differences between predictive and explanatory modeling is provided by Shmueli.73 Additionally, the proposed framework does not explicitly consider how the use of specific data types or models may influence explanation design and interpretation. For example, models that use image data would have a very different space of possible explanation designs than models that use text data. Similarly, the space of possible explanation designs would change based on the specific model used, as different models will have different model-specific approaches to 35 explanation (e.g., Gini importance to show feature influences in a Random Forest model). Moreover, users with knowledge of modeling approaches and their limitations may interpret predictions and explanations of specific models differently. Thus, it is important to acknowledge the potential role of specific data types and models in explanation design and interpretation; however, these considerations were outside the scope of the proposed framework. The framework is described in detail in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 provides guidance on how the framework can be applied within the larger context of the design and evaluation of explainable AI systems. Figure 8. Proposed framework for designing user-centered explanations. The framework was inspired by the frameworks of Wang et al.40 and Ribera and Laprediza42 and incorporates insights from work on explanations by Ras et al.20, Samek et al.,71 Lim et al.,41 and Doshi-Velez and Kim.43 36 3.1 Description of Framework The framework suggests that user-centered explanation design should be informed by the entire context of use of an explanation—that is, explanation design should consider not only who an explanation is being provided to and why they want that explanation, but also when and where that explanation will be used. Answering who, why, when, and where about the use of an explanation can be used to inform what information the explanation needs to contain (i.e., the content) and how that information needs to be provided (i.e. the presentation). As indicated by the relationships between the target questions indicated by grey dashed lines in Figure 8, these target questions are not orthogonal and are often co-dependent in that the answers to one question can and will be determined by the answers to other target questions. This introduces a partial ordering to the way in which target questions should be answered. More specifically, who an explanation is provided to and when/where that explanation is being provided should be answered first, as this information can then generally be used to answer why the explanation is needed. Similarly, who an explanation is provided to and why the explanation is needed typically determines the answer to what needs to be in the explanation. Finally, how the information in the explanation is presented to a user can generally be answered by who the explanation is provided to and when/where the explanation is being provided. As shown in Figure 8, each target question (who, why, when, where, what, and how) is associated with general factors that should be considered for each question (e.g., cognition and experience for who) along with some specific examples for each factor (e.g., AI expert). These are further discussed in the paragraphs below, following the suggested ordering for answering the questions. The answer to the target question who plays a major role in answering several other target questions and should be answered first. Prior work has tried to create categories of users to define 37 explanation design needs, but as Ras et al.20 noted, users often don’t fall into a single category. I assert that users can generally be defined by two aspects: 1) user cognition and experience (e.g., knowledge, capabilities, influence of prior experiences, etc.) and 2) the user’s relationship to the system at the time the explanation is being provided. Ribera and Lapedriza’s42 classifications of AI experts, domain experts, and lay persons capture the main categories of user cognition that appear in the literature. Ras et al.’s20 sub-categorizations of users (engineer, developer, owner, end-user, data subject, stakeholder) capture the various relationships a user may have with an AI system. In Figure 8, these sub-categorizations are generalized into the role of designer (engineer, developer), end user, and other interested party (owner, data subject, stakeholder). Defining users using these two dimensions overcomes the problem of trying to create mutually exclusive user categories to define needs. A user may have several different relationships with the system over time, and thus their explanation needs may change with varying roles. The when and where target questions are closely tied with the who target question, and also play a role in answering several other target questions. Perhaps the broadest classification of when/where an explanation is being used is related to the stage of the system, which often defines a user’s relationship to the system (e.g., during development the user relationship to the system is often that of designer). Explanations required during system development, implementation, and deployment will likely differ in design due to the different environmental settings associated with each stage. More specifically, when/where can be answered by considering the environment in which the explanation will be used and how the explanation needs to be designed in order to support use within that environment. Specifically, environment will dictate the constraints on the user (e.g., available time and cognitive capacity), the available technical resources, and the user’s perception of the system, which are all factors that may influence explanation design. 38 The why target question can often be answered by the answers to the who and when/where target question, as the user, their relationship to the system, and the environment in which they will be operating often affects why an explanation is sought. Although several prior works have identified various user needs and goals that drive the need for explanations, most of these can be captured in Samek et al.’s71 four broad categories of reasons why explanations of intelligent systems are required: 1) verification, 2) improvement, 3) learning, and 4) compliance. Verification includes examining how decisions/suggestions are made by the system to ensure it is operating as expected, which may include activities such as detecting biases, finding and debugging errors, and ensuring that system reasoning aligns with domain knowledge (justifiability). Improvement covers activities related to improving the system performance and efficiency, which may include things such as incorporating domain knowledge to reduce biases in or improve generalization of the system, comparing and selecting between models, and improving system response times. Learning refers to any activity where the user seeks to extract knowledge from the system, which may include identifying previously unknown data patterns, generating/testing new hypotheses, and improving decision-making accuracy or speed. Finally, compliance relates to any activities aimed at ensuring the system adheres to an established legal, moral, or other societal standard. It should be noted that these are not mutually exclusive categories (e.g., explanations for verification are also often used to guide improvement activities). When users request explanations in the context of decision-making, they are generally requesting explanations for verification (e.g. support for a specific decision suggested by the system) and/or explanations for learning (e.g., knowledge to support a decision-making process). The what target question refers to the content that needs to be included in an explanation. This can generally be determined by the answers to the who and why target questions, but 39 additional context and inquiry with the target users may be required. Depending on who is receiving the explanation and why they require it, the explanation design may need to be targeted at explaining either the internal processes of a system (i.e., how it specifically relates inputs to outputs) or its general behavior (i.e. input/output relationships only) and the explanation may need to be provided at the global (i.e., explains the entire model or system) or instance (i.e., explains a single prediction) level. The target and level of the explanation design can generally be determined by the type of explanation the user is seeking. Lim et al.41 provide a useful taxonomy of explanation types based on the intelligibility query they aim to answer: 1) “input” explanations, which provide information on the input values being used by a system; 2) “output” explanations, which provide information on specific outcomes/inferences/predictions; 3) “certainty” explanations, which provide information on the uncertainty of a certain output; 4) “why” explanations, which provide information on how a system obtained an output value based on certain input values (i.e., model traces or complete causal chains); 5) “why not”/”how to” explanations, which provide information on why an expected output was not produced based on certain input values (i.e., contrastive explanations, counterfactuals); 6) “what if” explanations, which provide information on expected changes in outputs based on certain changes in the input (i.e., explanations that permit outcome simulations); and 7) “when” explanations, which provide information on which circumstances produce a certain output (i.e., prototype or case-based explanations). It should be noted that these categories are not mutually exclusive and can be combined in various ways (e.g., it is possible to provide an “input”/”output”/”certainty”/”why not” explanation). Depending on user cognition and needs, the explanation may also need to be supported by additional information such as source data (e.g. raw data the model was built from), supplemental data (e.g., data not included in the 40 modeling process but relevant to the situation or context), and training materials (e.g., information on model development or explanation interpretation).40 The how target question refers to the way in which the content of an explanation is presented to a user, which can generally be determined by the answers to the who and when/where target questions. Summarizing and expanding upon the work of Doshi-Velez and Kim,43 the presentation of an explanation can generally be summarized using 4 main categories: 1) the unit of the explanation, or the form of the cognitive chunk being processed (e.g., raw features, feature summaries, images, or instances); 2) the organization of the explanation units, or the compositionality and relationship between the units, which may include groupings, hierarchical or relational organizations, or summary abstractions (e.g., free text summary of a combination of units); 3) the dimensionality, or processing size/levels of explanation information, which may include the overall size of an explanation and/or interactive exploration options; and 4) the manner in which information is represented, which includes the vocabulary, data structures, and visualizations used to express information. The specific choices in each of these four main categories will be determined by the user for whom an explanation is being provided (i.e., the who) and the environment in which it is being provided (i.e., the when/where). 3.2 Guidance on Application It is useful to consider the application of the framework in the context of Mohseni et al.’s44 three-level nested model to designing and evaluating an explainable AI system (see Figure 6 in section 2.2) and the taxonomy of evaluation approaches proposed by Doshi-Velez and Kim43 (see Figure 3 in section 2.1.3). Specifically, the context of use portion of the framework can provide 41 valuable information for design and evaluation at all three levels. The context of use can be elicited using a variety of approaches involving target users, including but not limited to, interviews, workshops, surveys, site visits, focus groups, and/or contextual inquiry. Literature insights on target users and/or their environment can also help elucidate certain aspects of a context of use, but it is best to include some level of target user input when defining an entire context of use to inform design. At the lowest level in Mohseni et al.’s44 model (Figure 6, Interpretable Models Level, red layer), where experts develop new approaches to model interpretability and explanations are typically evaluated using functionally-grounded approaches (i.e., no human involvement), the framework can help developers consider the users and environments for which their approach might be best suited. This could assist developers in marketing their approach to the right audience (e.g., model developers, lay users) or to inform design requirements for the approach if the developers intended to target specific end-users or environments. For example, if developing an explanation approach that is intended to be used by lay persons who have limited knowledge of modeling processes, developers might want to ensure their approach focuses on explaining system behavior over system processes. The framework can also be helpful in considering which metrics to use when evaluating an approach. For example, if the approach is intended to provide real-time explanations in a dynamic environment (e.g., explanations for a CDSS), evaluating the computational efficiency of the approach would be vital. The framework has direct applicability at the middle level in Mohseni et al.’s44 model (Figure 6, Explanation Interpretability Level, blue layer), where the goal is to design explanations that satisfy target user usability needs and where human-grounded evaluation approaches are typically utilized. Specifically, using the framework to define a context of use helps elucidate the 42 explanation design requirements that need to be met. With a defined context of use, design requirements can be defined and existing explanation approaches can be assessed to determine whether they meet or can be adapted to meet the specified requirements. Preliminary explanation designs can then be proposed and refined in a series of human-grounded evaluations utilizing target users. The context of use and defined design requirements can help in selecting evaluation metrics to use in these studies. For example, if an explanation is intended to be used in a fast-paced environment, then an evaluation study might compare proposed explanation designs by the ease and speed with which target users can process an explanation. At the highest level in Mohseni et al.’s44 model (Figure 6, Explainable AI Systems Outcome level, green layer), the explanation design has been finalized, and human-grounded and/or application-grounded evaluation approaches are employed to evaluate whether the system satisfies target-user needs. These evaluations usually involve domain-specific subjective and objective measures of the system impact on user task performance and perceptions of the system. By using the context of use of a system to define target user needs, the framework can assist in designing evaluation studies. For example, consider a system that is intended to be used for decision-making in a high stakes environment (e.g., medical decision making). Users may require that the accuracy and effectiveness of such a system be thoroughly validated before they would accept or use the system. This would suggest that a series of human-grounded evaluations with target users evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the system would be useful evidence to support an application-grounded evaluation of the impact of the system. In chapters 4-6, I demonstrate an application of the defined framework to design explanations for a model that predicts in-hospital mortality for pediatric ICU patients. In chapters 4 and 5, I demonstrate an application of the framework at the middle level of Mohseni et 43 al.’s44 model by 1) defining a context of use for the model based on literature insights and past experiences, 2) suggesting preliminary explanation designs, and 3) refining the context of use and explanation designs utilizing human-grounded evaluation approaches. In chapter 6, I demonstrate an application of the framework at the highest level of Mohseni et al.’s44 model by evaluating the predictive model with the refined explanation design to determine if the system satisfies target user needs. 44 4.0 Application of Framework to Suggest Explanation Designs for a Pediatric ICU In-hospital Mortality Risk Model In this chapter I apply the proposed framework to the problem of predicting mortality risk for patients admitted to the pediatric ICU. Mortality risk prediction is a common application of ML in medicine.87,88 In critical care, mortality prediction models have been used to establish performance benchmarks for outcome comparison and quality improvement initiatives, to define endpoints or illness severity adjustments in research studies, and to assist in clinical decision-making by providing early warnings of clinical deterioration.89 With regard to using these models for clinical decision-making in the critical care environment, there has been growing interest in utilizing data mining techniques and ML approaches to build customized prediction models using data from local electronic health record (EHR) data repositories.90–92 These models can be integrated into EHRs to provide real-time, individualized patient mortality risk predictions, which can assist critical care providers in surveilling patients for changes in acuity,93 determining clinical priorities,94 and providing support for making decisions about prognosis and treatment.95,96 As predictive models are often based on incomplete information about a patient, use of a predictive model in decision-making challenges providers to integrate information from the model with their own clinical knowledge.45,97 However, this process may require significant cognitive demands when providers do not understand the clinical basis for a prediction.45 Thus, healthcare providers are unlikely to use a prediction model in decision-making without explanations.45,93,97 Therefore, I applied the proposed framework to gain a better understanding of the potential benefit of providing user-centered explanations for mortality risk prediction models, specifically in the context of using the model to aid in decision-making processes. I focused the work on in-hospital 45 mortality risk for pediatric ICU patients, as there was a pre-existing dataset that could be used for model development. In section 4.1, I describe the development and evaluation of an in-hospital mortality risk prediction model for pediatric ICU patients. In section 4.2, I apply the framework by utilizing insights from the literature and my prior experiences in developing predictive models to define a context of use for the model and identify promising explanation design requirements. In section 4.3, I present preliminary explanation designs for the model that will be refined in human-grounded evaluations with target users. 4.1 Development and Evaluation of the Mortality Risk Prediction Model Data mining and ML approaches were utilized to develop a customized mortality risk prediction model for pediatric ICU patients at a single institution. As the main purpose of this work was to explore the utility of user-centered explanations for the model, a small, readily available dataset was utilized and no attempt was made to learn a best performing model. Section 4.1.1 describes the dataset and model development process while section 4.1.2 provides the results and final selected model. 4.1.1 Materials and Methods 4.1.1.1 Dataset Description This work utilized a pre-existing dataset including all discharged patients with a pediatric ICU admission at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) between January 1, 2015 and 46 December 31, 2016. Each hospitalization was treated as a separate encounter. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Pittsburgh approved the use of the data for this dissertation work (PRO17030743). For each encounter, the dataset included demographic information (age, sex, race), hospitalization data (time of admission and discharge), outcome data (discharge disposition and deceased date), assigned diagnoses, recorded locations, mechanical ventilation information, physical assessment measurements (vital signs, pupil reaction results, and Glasgow Coma Scale98 (GCS) measurement), and laboratory test results. Encounters with a length of stay of less than 24 hours or unknown age, sex, or admitting diagnosis were excluded from the analysis. Only encounters with at least one recorded physical assessment measurement or laboratory test result were included in the dataset. The target outcome to predict was in-hospital mortality, which was defined as an encounter with a recorded deceased date that occurred on or prior to the recorded discharge date. The aim was to predict in-hospital mortality 24 hours prior to the event, and all data collected prior to the time of the prediction was utilized. For death cases, this included all data collected up to 24 hours prior to death and for control cases, this included all data collected prior to discharge. 4.1.1.2 Data Cleaning The data cleaning processing was divided by categorical and numerical data types. Categorical data included sex, race, diagnoses, recorded locations, mechanical ventilation information, and pupil reaction results. Each categorical variable was mapped to a defined set of standard values. For sex, values were standardized to either “male” or “female”. For race, values were standardized to the six race/ethnicity categories defined by the Office of Management and Budget—“American Indian or Alaska Native”, “Asian”, “Black or African American”, “Native 47 Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander”, “White”, “Hispanic or Latino”)99—with the addition of categories for “unknown” and “multiple” races. Diagnoses were recorded in International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Versions 9 and 10, and ICD-9 codes were mapped to ICD-10 whenever possible using the General Equivalency Mapping files available on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website.100 Locations were standardized to one of seven generic unit types: “Direct Admit”, “Emergency Department”, “pediatric ICU”, “Other ICU”, “Inpatient”, “Outpatient”, or “Operating Room”. Left and right pupil reaction results were paired by timestamp and standardized to one of six possible values summarizing the results: “normal”, “one sluggish”, “both sluggish”, “one nonreactive” “one sluggish, one nonreactive”, “both nonreactive”. Pupil reaction results that could not be paired (e.g., did not have both a left and right pupil reading with the same timestamp) were removed. After standardizing the possible values for each categorical variable, all duplicate results were removed. Numerical data included age, length of stay, vital signs, GCS measurements, and laboratory test results. Laboratory test and vital sign values measured by more than one technique (e.g., invasive/non-invasive blood pressures) were grouped together and names were standardized (e.g., “heart rate” and “pulse” were both standardized to “heart rate”). Numeric results containing text (e.g., a comment or result interpretation) or invalid characters (e.g., “<”, “>”) were extracted and then any remaining non-numeric values were removed. Results of ‘0’ were also removed as these typically indicate a bad or invalid value in the EHR system. Finally, duplicate results were removed. 4.1.1.3 Feature Generation Features were defined separately for non-temporal and temporal data. Non-temporal data included age, sex, race, length of stay, mechanical ventilation information, recorded locations, and 48 diagnoses. Mechanical ventilation information was used to define a Boolean feature indicating presence or absence of a recorded ventilator event. Recorded locations were used to identify the pediatric ICU admitting unit (defined as the unit location immediately prior to the first recorded visit to the pediatric ICU). From the diagnoses, three features were extracted: 1) flag indicating presence of a cancer diagnosis (based on a pre-defined set of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes); 2) flag indicating presence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (based on a pre-defined set of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for cardiac arrest); and 3) admitting diagnosis ICD-10 code category (e.g., for ICD-10 code C40.10, “malignant neoplasm of short bones of upper limb”, code category would be C40, “malignant neoplasms of bone and articular cartilage of limbs”). For the admitting diagnosis ICD-10 code category, pediatric ICU admitting unit, and race features, categories with <30 observations were mapped to an “Other” category to ensure each possible category would be represented in the training dataset. Temporal data in the dataset included physical assessment measurements and laboratory test results collected at irregular time intervals. A fixed set of features was defined to summarize the time-series information. Pupil reaction was the only categorical measurement, and was summarized using five features: 1) first value, 2) most recent value, 3) second most recent value, 4) count of results where one pupil was non-reactive, and 5) count of results where both pupils were nonreactive. Each non-categorical temporal measurement was summarized using 17 features comprised of five point estimates (first, minimum, maximum, second most recent, and most recent values) and three trends (difference, percent change, and slope) between the most recent value and all other point estimates (12 features total). The final feature set included 422 features and is described in Table 4. Missing values were present within the feature set as not all encounters had measurements required to compute each feature. For categorical data, missing values were retained by simply 49 adding a “missing” category. For numerical data, the data were first discretized using the minimum description length criterion discretization method,101 which accounts for class information (e.g., in-hospital mortality status) when defining discretization bins. Missing values were then retained by including a “missing” category along with the discretized bins. All features were one-hot encoded prior to learning models. Table 4.

This split was used to simulate model performance when deployed into practice, where the model would be trained on prior years of data and be used to make predictions on future years of data that might include substantial differences from data of prior years. The training dataset was used to perform feature selection techniques and train models, while the test dataset was used to evaluate the models. Two popular strategies for feature selection were examined: 1) correlation-based feature subset (CFS) selection102, which aims to find a set of features that have high-correlation with in-hospital mortality but low inter-correlation with each other—that is, a set of non-redundant, highly informative features—and 2) information gain (IG) filter with a threshold of 0, which results in selecting features that contain at least some predictive information for in-hospital mortality. CFS feature selection was carried out using the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Acquisition) version 3.9.3 implementation103,104 via the Python package python-weka-wrapper3 version 0.1.7.105 IG feature selection was carried out using the Python package scikit-learn version 0.20.2.106 Several different models were trained, including a Logistic Regression model, which is the standard model utilized in the clinical domain, as well as three frequently utilized ML models—Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and SVM. Brief overviews of these algorithms can be found in Meyfroidt et al.107 All models were learned using algorithm implementations provided in the Python package scikit-learn version 0.20.2.106 Default algorithm settings were adopted for all algorithms, with the exception of the Random Forest model, which was learned using 100 trees instead of the default of 10 trees to improve the performance of the classifier. 51 Predictive performance of the models was evaluated using the test dataset. Model discrimination was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Due to the large class imbalance in the dataset (only 2% of encounters were death cases), predictive performance was also assessed by calculating the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The AUPRC is an informative predictive measure that complements the AUROC for imbalanced datasets, i.e., datasets where the outcome of interest occurs rarely.108 All analyses were performed using R version 3.5.0.109 AUROCs and 95% CIs were calculated using the pROC package 1.15.3110 and AUPRCs were calculated using the PRROC package version 1.3.1.111 4.1.2 Results The final dataset included 4,910 encounters (93 in-hospital deaths; 4,817 controls; 1.9% in-hospital mortality rate). The training and test datasets comprised 2,480 (42 in-hospital deaths; 2,438 controls; 1.7% in-hospital mortality rate) and 2,430 encounters (51 in-hospital deaths; 2,379 controls; 2.0% in-hospital mortality rate), respectively. A total of eight models were learned, comprising each combination of feature selection technique and model type (Table 5). Model performance measured by AUROC and AUPRC was comparable for all models, with the exception of the Naïve Bayes model using the IG feature selection approach, which had a very low AUPRC. The Random Forest model using the IG feature selection approach was the highest performing model when examining both AUROC and AUPRC, and thus was selected as the model for which explanations would be designed. 52 Table 5.

All insights are derived from my prior experiences in developing predictive models as well as from an informal review of the literature on interpretable ML, social science work on human explanation and medical decision-making, HCI, information visualization, CDSS (specifically barriers, facilitators, and provider perceptions), and predictive models evaluated by providers or implemented in practice. I focused specifically on using the predictive model as a tool to support clinical decision-making in the critical care setting by serving as a proxy measure for deteriorating clinical acuity. The end goal of such a system would be to impact critical care provider decision-making and improve clinical outcomes; however, when designing explanations, the more immediate goal would be to promote system adoption. It has been shown that adoption of predictive models can be influenced by provider perceptions of the model utility, credibility, and usability.112 Thus, it is useful to consider how the framework might inform explanation designs that positively influence these perceptions of the system. For the purpose of this discussion, I defined utility as the perceived 53 benefit or usefulness of the model (i.e., whether providers can extract meaningful or actionable information from the model), credibility as the “believability” or “persuasiveness” of the model (i.e., whether the model predictions and reasoning processes seem unbiased and aligned with domain knowledge), and “usability” as the feasibility of using the model as part of clinical practice (i.e., ease with which the model can be understood and integrated with existing workflows). In sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, I discuss the target questions in the framework, building upon answers to prior questions when appropriate. For each target question, I address the current understanding of the question based on the available literature and highlight gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in studies with the target users. Figure 9 provides a summary of the insights for each target question and serves as a guide for the discussions sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. In section 4.2.3 I provide a brief commentary on how the answers to these target questions can inform explanation designs that positively influence provider perceptions of the utility, credibility, and usability of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Figure 9. Summary of an initial context of use and a possible space of explanation designs for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. All insights were derived from the literature and prior experiences in developing predictive models for healthcare. 54 4.2.1 Context of Use In this section, I define an initial context of use for explanations for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model by summarizing the current understanding of who might need an explanation, when and where they might require that explanation, and why they want the explanation. I recognize that prior experiences and the literature will not provide a complete picture of the context of use, and thus highlight gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in approaches involving the identified target users. Who Current understanding: The target users for the model are critical care providers. Any member of a critical care team (e.g., nurses, residents, fellows, attending physicians, etc.) would be interested in deteriorating clinical acuity of a patient, and thus might find the predictive model of use. For decision-making in the clinical setting, the relationship of all providers to the model at the time of explanation would be that of an end-user of the system (as opposed to a designer if the scenario of interest was in soliciting expert feedback for model improvement). In terms of user cognition, critical care providers will fall under Ribera and Lapedriza’s “domain expert” category42 and they will typically lack the knowledge to understand and critically evaluate ML models for use in practice.1,5 Moreover, there is evidence in the literature that providers have difficulties in interpreting risk and probability-based estimates,12,96,112,113 which suggests that providers might also struggle to understand and evaluate prediction models that employ traditional statistical approaches (e.g., logistic regression models). In addition to user cognition, past experiences of a user could influence their explanation needs and design requirements. For example, negative experiences with past predictive models or 55 health information technology may lead users to require that an explanation include specific information or be designed in a specific manner to prevent recurrence of past experiences. Examples of negative experiences with health information technology and predictive models in the literature include: 1) inappropriate or disruptive alerts,93,97,112,114,115 2) high effort to use the system,35,37,45,112 3) information that lacks clinical utility (e.g., incorrect, irrelevant, not actionable),36,45,46,112 and 4) lack of control.36,112 Gaps in knowledge: The level of statistical and ML knowledge of critical care providers is unknown, although the literature suggests that most providers will have a limited understanding of the topics. It has been shown that critical care providers employ different information seeking strategies based on their clinical training and role in the patient care process,116 which suggests that users with different clinical positions and knowledge may require different explanations for the same predictive model. These possible differences require further exploration in reference to the target users. Although the literature highlights some possible negative experiences that critical care providers may have previously had with health information technology and predictive models, the influence of past experiences will vary by user and setting and again requires further exploration regarding target users. When and where Current understanding: For use in clinical decision-making where critical care providers are end-users of the predictive model, explanations will be provided at the deployment/implementation stage of the system. For the predictive model, this would constitute use of the explanation in the pediatric ICU, which is a complex, dynamic environment where information is abundant and decisions are time-sensitive. To be useful in clinical decision-making 56 in this environment, a predictive model must be able to keep up with the influx of data to provide real-time predictions (and explanations)3,12,34 and be regularly updated to reflect changes in patient populations and care processes.89,117 Additionally, evidence suggests that a successful tool should support existing clinical workflows,35,37,45,112 such as respecting a provider’s available time and current cognitive load. More specifically, the tool (and by extension its explanations) should avoid contributing to information overload118,119 or requiring large time investments to use (e.g., manual data entry).35,45,96,115 Gaps in knowledge: As workflow fit is an important factor of successful adoption, further exploration of the pediatric ICU workflow and environment is required. Why Current understanding: To use the predictive model in decision-making, a healthcare provider must be able to integrate the model information with their knowledge, experience, and missing contextual information and then translate the information into a meaningful decision.3,45,93,97 This process usually occurs at the patient-level (i.e. for an individual prediction), and involves the closely related goals of verification and learning. In verification, providers assess a prediction to determine if it is clinically relevant (i.e., aligns with domain knowledge) before using it to inform clinical decisions. Verification is especially important in the context of ML, as models that perform well on average are often based on statistical associations and imperfect data,3,12 may be missing important information about a patient (e.g. contextual information),45,113 and may therefore have significant individual level errors.1,120 Providers must be able to understand model limitations and identify errors to determine whether a risk prediction applies to a specific patient and defend any decisions based on the prediction.1,3,6,12,97,121 When learning from 57 a predictive model system, providers extract knowledge from the system to assist in decision-making, which may include informing or confirming clinical judgments95 and deriving actionable insights (e.g., identifying potentially modifiable risk factors).7,96,112 Verification and learning often occur simultaneously, such as when providers investigate discrepancies in the match between their knowledge and the model’s knowledge (i.e., a prediction seems too high or low). They may start by looking for a source of model error (verification) but end up discovering a risk factor that was overlooked (learning). Gaps in knowledge: Verification of and learning from individual predictions are assumed to be the main explanation goals for critical care providers using the model in decision-making, but it is worth verifying this assumption with the target users. Additionally, discussions with target users can help elucidate the information they require to verify model predictions as well as determining what information they would be interested in learning from the model. 4.2.2 Explanation Design Requirements In this section, I utilize the defined context of use and insights from prior experiences and the literature to suggest promising design requirements for what information the explanation needs to contain and how to provide that information to target users. I recognize that this approach will not clearly identify all explanation design requirements, and thus highlight gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in approaches involving target users. What Possible explanation design requirements: The target user goals are verification and learning, which the literature suggests can be supported by showing the influence of risk factors 58 on a specific prediction, as this facilitates comparison with clinical knowledge and can assist in deriving actionable insights.45,93,96,97,121 This finding suggests that target users are likely seeking contrastive explanations (“why not” type explanations) for specific predictions, or explanations that demonstrate which inputs are pushing the prediction toward one outcome over another. As the target users are expected to have limited ML knowledge, explanations targeted at explaining model behavior, or relationships between inputs and outputs, are likely appropriate. Moreover, as it is expected that the target users will use individual predictions to assist in decision-making, it also seems appropriate to provide explanations at the instance-level (i.e. patient-level explanations). Prior work has supported the use of instance-level explanations for predictive models in healthcare as they provide insights on individual patients and thus support precision medicine initiatives.10,16 The aforementioned design requirements can be met by existing post-hoc explanation approaches that provide instance-level explanations based on feature influence values. Utilizing a model-agnostic approach to explanation would provide further benefit, as the environment of use requires that the explanations place limited burdens on cognitive load and processing time and that the predictive model be continually updated over time. A model-agnostic explanation approach would allow the explanation design to be tailored to reduce cognitive load and processing time without having any impact on the underlying predictive model or its accuracy. Moreover, a model-agnostic explanation approach allows the predictive model to adapt over time with minimal changes to an explanation design familiar to providers. Gaps in knowledge: Although the context of use and literature insights support the use of model-agnostic, instance-level, explanation approaches based on feature influence methods, the utility of these explanations has not been verified in studies with healthcare providers. It is also unclear from the literature what supporting information critical care providers might need to 59 understand these explanations. Inquires with target users are required to validate the appropriateness of these explanations and understand what supporting information facilitates target user understanding of the explanation. Moreover, it is unclear from the literature whether “why not” type explanations will be sufficient for the target users; other types of explanations may be required (e.g., “what if” explanations that allow providers to simulate how a change in a feature affects a patient’s prediction). How Identified design requirements: As model-agnostic, instance-level, explanation approaches based on feature influence methods were identified as a promising explanation approach, design options discussed in this section relate to the presentation of these types of explanations. As the target users are expected to have limited understanding of ML and will be using explanations in a cognitively demanding and time-constrained environment, explanation content should be presented in a manner that facilitates information processing with minimal demands on cognition and time. When considering the unit of explanation, utilizing larger cognitive chunks can reduce the cognitive load and processing time required. For instance-level explanations of feature influence, a larger cognitive chunk could be obtained by grouping features by laboratory test or vital sign instead of showing the individual features derived for each test or vital sign. There is some evidence supporting the use of feature groupings and high-level feature abstractions for non AI/ML experts.63 Organizing explanation units into meaningful groups can also potentially reduce the cognitive load and processing time. For explanations based on feature influence, the standard organization of explanation units would simply be a list of the features in decreasing magnitude of 60 influence on the prediction (i.e. a ranked list). However, there is some evidence that users prefer meaningful groupings of explanation units over ranked lists.122 Social science literature indicates that humans prefer explanations that include causes that are abnormal or controllable (i.e., modifiable),27 suggesting that grouping explanation units by these factors might prove more informative. For instance-level explanations of feature influence, grouping by abnormality could be achieved by grouping features by whether they increase or decrease the predicted risk. Grouping by controllability or modifiability could be simulated by grouping features by whether they are static (i.e., cannot be changed through intervention such as age) or dynamic (i.e., could be changed through intervention such as a laboratory test result). Reducing the dimensionality of an explanation can also lead to decreased demands on processing time and cognitive load, but must be balanced with a user’s ability to understand a prediction. Dimensionality refers to the level of detail of the explanation, which can be reduced through information removal (e.g., reducing explanation size) or aggregation (e.g., reducing explanation granularity). There is some evidence in the literature that the desired dimensionality of an explanation will vary by individual and prediction, i.e., some users prefer more detailed explanations and users often want more detailed explanations for high risk predictions,68,122 which suggests that controlling dimensionality via interactive options may be beneficial. This aligns with concepts from social science literature that explanation should occur as part of a conversation, where users may ask for additional information or explanations after receiving the initial explanation.27,56 For the model with instance-level explanations of feature influence, interactive options for controlling dimensionality could include control over the granularity of the units of explanation (e.g., whether to view individual features or feature groups), control over how units of 61 explanation are organized or grouped (e.g., by increasing/decreasing risk), and/or control over the size of the explanation (number of units of explanation shown). Finally, the vocabulary, data structures, and visualizations used to express information can impact how effectively critical care providers can process an explanation. The vocabulary of the explanation should include standard clinical terms familiar to the critical care providers and should represent risk in a format with which critical care providers are comfortable. The literature suggests that visual or graphical representations of risk information can facilitate healthcare provider comprehension of risk, but this has not been validated in user studies.96 For instance-level explanations of feature influence, it should be clear to critical care providers how each feature contributes to the predicted risk. For feature influence explanations, feature contributions to the predicted risk have been previously represented in terms of odds or probability (e.g., a feature increases risk 2-fold or by 10%) and visualized using tornado plots and custom visualizations called force plots (see Figure 12 in section 4.3 for an example).75,123 Gaps in knowledge: Overall, the context of use and literature provide some possible design options that might prove beneficial when presenting instance-level explanations of feature influence for predictions from the model. However, discussions and feedback from the target users are required to further understand how critical care provider cognitive load and processing time might be affected by 1) what units of explanation are used (e.g., feature groupings or individual features), 2) how the units of explanation are organized (e.g., no grouping, grouping by increasing/decreasing risk, grouping by dynamic/static), 3) what interactive options are provided for controlling explanation dimensionality, and 4) what vocabulary, data structures, and visualizations are used to present the predicted risk, the explanation, and any supporting information. 62 4.2.3 Potential impact on perceptions As discussed in section 4.2.1, explanations for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model would likely be used by critical care providers who: 1) have limited knowledge of statistical and ML concepts (who), 2) work in a cognitively demanding and time-constrained environment (when/where), and 3) would be seeking explanations to assist them in verifying predictions from the model and learning information that can assist in decision-making (why). Therefore, as discussed in section 4.2.2, the explanation design should contain (what): 1) content that supports a provider’s current information goals (e.g., verification and learning), which would likely increase the perceived utility and credibility of the model; and 2) appropriate supporting information to help a provider interpret the explanation, which would likely increase the perceived usability of the predictive model. Moreover, the explanation design should present information (how) in a manner that reduces the cognitive load and processing time required by a provider, which would likely increase the perceived usability of the model. 4.3 Preliminary Explanation Designs As noted in section 4.2.2, there are several aspects of the explanation design that require further investigation in discussions with target users. To facilitate these discussions, I proposed preliminary explanation designs for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. As per the insights from section 4.2, I focused on suggesting explanation designs for model-agnostic, instance-level explanations based on feature influence methods to better understand the potential utility of these types of explanations within the healthcare domain. 63 Two popular and publicly-available model-agnostic, instance-level explanation algorithms have been previously applied to predictive modeling problems in the healthcare domain—the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm64,123 and the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm.124,125 The LIME algorithm generates an explanation for a prediction by learning an interpretable model (e.g., sparse linear regression) that fits the local decision boundary near the instance of interest. The SHAP algorithm is based on concepts from game theory and is theoretically guaranteed to be faithful to the underlying predictive model. It unifies several alternative instance-level explanation algorithms into a single approach, including the LIME algorithm. A detailed description of both algorithms is available in Appendix A. To generate model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model, the SHAP algorithm was used after a series of experiments comparing the two algorithms revealed that the LIME algorithm did not guarantee local fidelity and required more computation time. The experiments are described in Appendix A. Based on insights from section 4.2, I mocked-up five explanation designs for the SHAP explanations to solicit critical care provider feedback on the following explanation design options: 1.) Unit of explanation—individual features (low granularity) vs. feature groupings by lab test/vital sign (high granularity) 2.) Organization of explanation units—no groupings, grouping by influence on risk (i.e. whether the unit increases/decreases risk), grouping by assessment (e.g., laboratory test features, physical assessment test features, demographic/healthcare utilization features) which was used as an approximation of the controllability of features 3.) Dimensionality—static vs. modifiable explanation (i.e., interactive options to control explanation size and granularity of explanation unit) 64 4.) Risk representation—probability vs. odds 5.) Explanation display format—tornado plot vs. force plot Each mock-up included the predicted risk of mortality from the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model, an explanation for the predicted risk from the SHAP algorithm, and supporting information to assist in interpreting the risk and explanation. Mock-ups varied in explanation design options and were organized into two sets based on the different design options. The mock-up sets are summarized in Table 6 and the explanations for each mock-up are shown in Figures 10-14. By default, mock-ups with feature groups for the unit of explanation included groupings by influence within the explanation plot (i.e., each feature group had factors that increased or decreased the risk). Mock-ups with feature groups and tornado plots also included an interactive hover-box option to view the individual level features within each group (i.e., modifiable granularity of explanation unit). For mock-ups with modifiable explanation size, an interactive option to scroll down the explanation plot to view additional features was included. Table 6.

An example of the supporting information included in each mock-up is shown in Figure 15. SHAP explanations were generated using the Python package shap version 0.27.0126 and mock-ups were generated as interactive HTML pages using the Python package bokeh version 1.0.4.127 Figure 10.

More specifically, I aimed to: 1.) Assess critical care provider attitudes about using the predictive model in practice 2.) Assess critical care provider perceptions of the model-agnostic, instance-level approach for explaining predictions from the model 3.) Explore critical care provider preferences on the design options proposed in the mock-ups to identify those that facilitate understanding of and positively influence perceptions of the model Insights from the focus group were used to inform a final user-centered explanation design to be used in a laboratory study to evaluate the impact of a user-centered explanation design on critical care provider decision-making and perceptions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Section 5.1 describes the materials and methods of the study, section 5.2 summarizes the main results, and section 5.3 presents the final user-centered explanation design. 70 5.1 Materials and Methods 5.1.1 Setting and Participants All focus groups were conducted at CHP during March 2019-June 2019. A convenience sample of pediatric critical care providers of differing clinical expertise (e.g., nurses, residents, fellows, attending physicians) was recruited through professional connections of one of the dissertation committee members to participate in focus group sessions. Participants were assigned to sessions based on availability. The study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh IRB. 5.1.2 Procedures and Data Collection I conducted a total of three focus group sessions, each ~1.5 hr in length and comprising 5-8 participants. Each participant attended only a single focus group session, during which they were asked to participate in four activities: 1) Background questionnaire (~5 mins): Participants were asked to complete a background questionnaire assessing their clinical experience, familiarity with predictive modeling, and perceptions of predictive analytics. 2) Model discussion (~30 mins): Participants listened to a presentation on the development of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model and then participated in a guided group discussion about their initial perceptions of the model. 3) Mock-up review discussion (~50 mins): Participants received brief training on interpreting explanation information and then participated in a guided group review and critique of the five mock-ups of explanation designs for predictions from the 71 pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Mock-ups were reviewed by set. For each set, mock-ups were discussed individually and then presented side-by-side to facilitate discussions of preferences for the different design options. Participants were provided with print-outs of each mock-up and encouraged to write comments and design suggestions on the sheets. 4) Ranking questionnaire (~5 min): Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to indicate their preferred variation of each design option presented in the mock-ups and to rank the options in order of perceived importance in understanding the model prediction. A focus group script and question guides were developed and followed for each session. Copies of the background questionnaire, question guides for the discussion activities, and the ranking questionnaire can be found in Appendix B. Focus group sessions were moderated by 1-2 researchers and a separate researcher took notes during each session. All sessions were audio-recorded and all materials (questionnaires, print-outs of mock-ups) were collected from participants at the end of each session. 5.1.3 Data Analysis Background questionnaire and ranking questionnaire responses were summarized using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Audio recordings of the sessions were transcribed verbatim and written participant comments on mock-up print-outs were compiled by session. Transcripts and written participant comments were analyzed using descriptive coding.128 One analyst developed an initial codebook with the concepts and definitions from the proposed framework along with codes to capture participant perceptions of the utility, credibility, and 72 usability of the system. The analyst then applied the codes to the transcripts and written participant comments, refining definitions and adding codes to more finely represent the participants’ responses. A second analyst used the codebook to independently code one session transcript. The two analysts discussed coding differences to resolve disagreements and achieve consensus on a final codebook (Appendix C). The first analyst then recoded all transcripts and written participant comments. QSR International’s NVivo 12 software129 was used to assign and organize codes. Session notes recorded by the researchers were not coded, but were used to assist in coding and interpretation. This analysis was intended to identify insights related to each of the target questions in the proposed framework to address the gaps in knowledge identified in section 4.2. Insights from the coding process were analyzed in conjunction with questionnaire responses to summarize findings about the context of use and explanation design and identify elements that influence critical care provider perceptions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. 5.2 Results A total of 21 critical care providers participated in the three focus group sessions. Table 7 summarizes the clinical experience of the participants in each session. The following sections summarize insights on the context of use and explanation design for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model, specifically highlighting factors that influenced perceptions of the model.

Table 9 and Figure 16 summarize the participants’ background knowledge and attitudes towards predictive modeling, respectively. Insights identified for each of the target questions related to context of use (who, when/where, why) are summarized with supporting quotes in Table 10. Although the insights are separated out by target question in Table 10, I summarize the findings about the context of use as a whole. Table 8.

All providers compared the model information against domain knowledge; however, providers with more detailed knowledge of predictive modeling also wanted information about the development process (e.g., cohort 74 definition, data collection and cleaning procedures) and how the model compared to similar, existing models. Perceptions of model credibility were positively influenced by the high predictive performance and model predictions that aligned with domain knowledge (i.e., the participant could clinically rationalize why the model made the prediction). Perceptions of model credibility were negatively influenced by limitations in the modelling process (e.g., not accounting for feature correlations) and model information that did not align with clinical knowledge (e.g., errors in data values, predictions based on outliers or with counterintuitive risk factors).

Participant attitudes towards predictive analytics 75 Participants generally had positive attitudes towards using predictive analytics in clinical practice (Figure 16), and saw several possible applications for information from the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. The information participants sought from the model depended on their clinical role (Table 10, User cognition) and factors related to their work environment (Table 10, Social and organizational influences). Physicians anticipated using the model to facilitate patient prioritization during rounds and sought to gain insights about the condition of patients (Table 10, Learning). They viewed the model as a useful tool to help them synthesize patient information and alert them to high-risk patients and/or concerning information. Nurses anticipated using the tool to assist in communicating changes in patient conditions to physicians and generally sought actionable information from the model. They wanted to be alerted to clinically important changes in patient condition and be given information to either intervene or justify a request for a physician consult. However, prior experiences with alerting systems raised concerns from the nurses about appropriate timing and relevance of alerts (Table 10, User cognition). Regardless of clinical role, information seen as clinically irrelevant (e.g., a high risk prediction driven by a low Coma score for a sedated and paralyzed patient) contributed to negative perceptions of model utility. Information that would be difficult to process within the constraints of the ICU environment (Table 10, Cognitive and time resources) also contributed to negative perceptions of usability. Participants did not generally seek explanations to help them improve the model, but negative perceptions of the model prompted participants to suggest improvements (Table 10, Improvement). These included incorporating additional relevant predictors (e.g., medications), predicting additional outcomes (e.g., morbidity), defining normal ranges for variables (either by age or by setting patient-specific baselines), setting patient-specific alert thresholds, and incorporating domain knowledge into the model. 76 Table 10. Insights on context of use target questions Topic Insights Who User Cognition Large variation in knowledge of predictive modeling “Are we enabling the computer take over?” “Seems like there’s a lot of collinearity there. And if those are two of the main contributors, I’m wondering whether it’s overestimating” Negative experiences with prior systems due to insufficient training, irrelevant information, and inappropriate disruptions in workflow “They trigger a sepsis screen every time I do vitals or every 2 hours and you call the doctors and they have to come down and see them and they’re getting really irritated. They don’t want to have to do that, they don’t have time.” “Most people didn’t know how to use the Rothman index.” Clinical role affects how providers anticipate using model information “From the attending perspective, when you walk in in the morning who do you need to see first? Who maybe is higher risk than people are appreciating? Or is changed based on data that’s emerged in the last few hours?” When/where Cognitive and time resources Providers have limited available time to process information “I don’t know if—working on the floor—I get an alert that I have time to go and look through all of this data to try and figure out where the risk is coming from.” Providers have limited available cognitive capacity and attention to process information “If you load it with a lot of numbers that will probably be not helpful…Because it dilutes your attention.” “Trying to think about what that actually means…one, you could be wrong, or if it’s 3:00 in the morning…some of the mental gymnastics you’d have to do.” Social and organizational influences Workflow and social factors determine how providers anticipate using model information “Typically, I round on new patients and then I round on any ECMO patients…and then with some filler between, I break up and it’s somewhat random where I start” “I think it might help with the doctors…If there’s another number—something saying ‘here, look at this, this is actually showing that there’s something going on.’….Because I get push back all the time.” Why Verification Providers desired comparisons to existing models and information on model development processes to help validate model “And is it better than PRISM or is it the same?” “We’re assuming that you didn’t just select for the sickest patients in this cohort.” “Does this weed out their error of charting, things like this?” Providers validated model information by comparing to domain knowledge “I mean arterial pressure of 250 seems physiologically impossible.” “The leading variables are patient is having respiratory issues and has kidney injury…from a face validity standpoint—yes, that sounds like a patient with a higher risk of dying.” Improvement Providers were interested in improving the performance and utility of the model “It’d be nice to look at morbidity as well and other things.” “One of the critical things that you might consider finding a way to incorporate into the score is medications.” “I do think, from a model validity standpoint, changing this to include maybe abnormal blood pressure for age, does add a lot.” Learning Providers wanted to use the model to gain insights about patient conditions “Does this model offer new information that I didn’t already have? Like ‘this patient was at high risk for mortality and I didn’t otherwise recognize that.’” “Just telling you what you should know, and what you would appreciate if you clicked into the chart and dove into the information, but at least this is synthesizing that for you.” Providers sought actionable information from the model “Can I do anything to mitigate that risk of mortality based on what I know?” “I don’t think there’s a lot I can do about most of that stuff…” 77 5.2.2 Insights on Explanation Design Table 11 provides a high-level summary of the insights on explanation design discussed in this section, specifically the content to include in the explanation design as well as the preferred design options that would positively influence perceptions of usability. Explanation design was not observed to influence perceptions of credibility or utility. Participant preferences for each design option and the perceived importance rankings of each option are summarized in Figures 17 and 18, respectively. Insights identified for each of the target questions related to explanation design (what, how) are summarized with examples quotes in Table 12. Findings about the explanation design are summarized below, referring to insights on the context of use where appropriate. Table 11. High-level summary of insights on explanation design Desired content (what) Benefits Preferred design options (how) Explanations:  instance-level, model behavior (SHAP explanations)  global-level, model processes  Assess model credibility and utility  Risk expressed as percent probability  Feature groups with details on demand  Interactive options to support different displays/organizations for various users  Familiar icons  Readable from left/right or top/bottom Table of raw feature values  Interpret discretized features  Examine trend-based features  Directionality for trend-based features  Simpler terminology Time-series data plots  Investigate suspicious values  Assess trends and baselines  Multiple plots  Highlight points related to features  Auto-population of data Contextual information  Clinically meaningful interpretation N/A Risk baselines and trends  Context for risk prediction  Prominent display of baseline risk By providing the plots of the SHAP explanation, the list of predictors that went into the model, and the predicted risk from the model, each mock-up provided “why not”2, “input”, and 2SHAP explanations show which inputs are responsible for pushing a prediction toward one outcome over another, which means they are contrastive explanations. This makes them “why not” type explanations. 78 “output” type explanations, respectively. Participant questions about the model indicated that they were seeking these types of explanations, with some providers also seeking “what if” type explanations, i.e., how the output might change if an input is changed (Table 12, Type, target, and level of explanation). Participants sought all types of explanations when verifying model information (Table 10, Verification), but typically sought “why not” type explanations when seeking information for use in clinical practice (Table 10, Learning). The instance-level explanations of model behavior provided by the SHAP algorithm were generally perceived as helpful in assessing model credibility and utility; however, some providers also requested global-level explanations and explanations of model processes (Table 12, Type, target, and level of explanation). Although useful in assessing credibility and utility, type of explanation was not observed to have a specific influence on participant perceptions of the model. Figure 17. Particpant preferences for design options by clinical role 79 Figure 18. Participant rankings of design options by perceived importance The supporting information provided in the mock-ups was vital to participant interpretation of the prediction and explanation, and in general helped participants assess the credibility and utility of the model information (Table 10, Verification; Table 10, Learning). Participants frequently utilized the table of the raw values of the features used in the model (i.e., undiscretized feature values), the interactive plot to view the raw values of time series data from laboratory tests and vital signs, and contextual information (e.g., diagnoses) to assist in their interpretation (Table 12, Supporting information). Participants found that the raw values of features used in the model helped them when interpreting the discretized features used in the explanation. For example, if the most predictive feature in the explanation was “Cr change from min >0.35” (i.e. the most recent value of creatinine has increased more than 0.35 since the minimum value), participants found that to assess the clinical importance of the feature it was helpful to also know the exact amount creatinine had increased, as well as what the current and minimum values of creatinine were. Plots 80 of the raw values of time series data from laboratory tests and vital signs were often utilized to verify model information, specifically to investigate suspicious values (e.g., outliers or errors), assess trend-based features, and determine patient baselines (e.g., if the patient normally has an elevated creatinine level). Contextual information not included in the model (e.g., diagnoses, interventions) was considered essential to assess the clinical validity and relevance of the prediction. For example, when examining a high-risk prediction that included a low coma score as a top predictor, participants noted that they would give less weight to that prediction if the patient was sedated and paralyzed, which would explain the low coma score. Participants also wanted information about the baseline risk of mortality, the trend of mortality risk over time, and proper interpretation/use of the explanations (Table 12, Supporting information). The baseline risk of mortality was considered helpful in properly interpreting the predicted risk of mortality (e.g., a predicted risk of 50% is much more concerning when the baseline risk is 2%). Trends of mortality risk over time were also requested (mainly by nurses) to improve model utility, as it was noted that a change in risk was of more clinical interest than a single predicted risk (e.g., a patient that has had a high predicted risk for several days is of less concern than a patient with a lower predicted risk that has been recently increasing). Finally, although not specifically requested to be included in the explanation, several participants pointed out that training on interpretation of the prediction explanation would be vital to prevent improper use of the system (i.e., predictors are not suggestive of interventions to reduce mortality risk). Although useful in assessing credibility and utility, supporting information elements were not observed to have a specific influence on participant perceptions of the model. 81 Table 12. Insights on explanation design target questions Topic Insight What Type, target, and level of explanation Providers sought “input”, “output”, “certainty”, “why not”, and “what if” explanations “Do I get a confidence interval somewhere?” “The first question I get when I talk to the doctor is ‘well, why did that happen?’” Some desire for explanations of model processes and at the global-level “What’s the weight of the data that is available from the moment they did transfer them to the ICU and how does that carry into this predictive model?” “Is it possible to see what the machine learned about the relationship between age and raw numbers of vital signs?” Supporting information Raw feature values, raw time-series data, and contextual information aid interpretation “Can I see the data for the blood pressure? Like a 57-point deviation in mean arterial pressure is quite substantial.” “Everything bad that’s happening with this patient seems to be contributed by the Coma Score…Now I see a diagnosis code of a brain tumor I’d give it much more weight.” Providers wanted to see baseline risk and trends of risk prediction over time “This doesn’t show like ‘okay, the in-hospital mortality odds, 3 hrs ago was 1.6 and now it's actually coming down?” “I also think that an odds of death of 12% is still concerning—this child is 10 times more likely to die than the average child in our ICU.” Providers stressed importance of proper training on explanation interpretation “One risk, I think, with this type of data presentation, is I are going to over-interpret the results…this is just showing you how the model worked, it doesn’t necessarily mean the model is saying you should act on these specific [factors]” How Unit of explanation and organization Providers preferred feature groupings for the initial explanation display “I really appreciate the groupings on this graph…I said well there’s only an 8% risk of death but it’s being driven largely by this neuro bucket, so what’s going on there?” Providers had mixed preferences on organization of predictors “I like 2-2…I mean because that’s how my brain thinks—I mean I break things down by that a lot of times in my head—physical assessments, labs, that sort of thing…” “Being able to see these are the top 5 increase mortality, these are the top 5 lower mortality...as opposed to the 2-2, where I can just see sort of graph fatigue” Dimensionality Providers wanted interactive linkage of data across plots and tables “I also like that clicking on the graph directs you to the associated lab/physical assessment in the data table.” “Is it possible that when you click on lactate results it could both bring up the raw data graph as well as the little components of the lactate table? Interactive control over unit of explanation supported different information needs “With the hover capability, if people wanted more, they could have that…I have a basic that everybody can get the basic data, but if you want to dig deeper it’s there.” Information representation Providers preferred risk to be presented as probabilities expressed as percentages “I actually took out a calculator and based on the odds, I calculated the patient’s percent probability of death.” “For me, percent risk of mortality is going to be easier to interpret than the odds.” Providers preferred less statistical terminology for describing trend-based features “It would be nice if I could just say, ‘pulse ox is decreasing, creatinine is increasing’” Visual cues play an important role in interpretation and design preferences “It’s because of the scale of the bars. The tighter bars just don’t grab my attention.” “I think with mock-up 1-3, my first initial thought is to look—you read left to right. So I would think the SpO monitor results would be the highest contributor.” Provider had mixed preferences on explanation display format “I think 1-3 actually gives you the most visually, because you can see every element that’s playing into that...I would suspect that there are other people who are going to look at 1-1 or 1-2 and it’s going to be very obvious to them what they’re looking at.” “In my head, I’m thinking what about a pie chart?” 82 Participants exhibited strong preferences for the unit of explanation and risk representation design options, but had mixed preferences for other design options (Figure 17). In general, strong preferences on design options correlated with increased perceived importance of the design element (Figure 18). More specifically, all participants felt very strongly that risk be displayed in probabilities expressed as percentages (Figure 17; Figure 18; Table 12, Information representation). Expressing risk in terms of odds or as proportions seemed to increase the cognitive effort required to process the risk, thus negatively influencing the perceived usability of the system. All participants also expressed strong preferences for using feature groups (e.g., larger cognitive chunks) as the unit of explanation (Figure 17; Figure 18; Table 12, Information representation). Although the interactive option to view the individual features within each feature group was generally well-received (Table 12, Dimensionality), showing individual features in the initial explanation display appeared to require more cognitive effort to process and thus negatively influenced the perceived usability of the system. Some participants wanted even higher-level units of explanation than the feature groups, such as groups of related labs (e.g., electrolytes) or summary explanations akin to a human explanation (e.g., “This patient is at high risk for mortality because they are comatose, newly hypotensive, have been progressively hypoxic and have newly developed lactic acidosis”). The mixed preferences observed for the organization of explanation units (Figure 17; Table 12, Unit of explanation and organization) and explanation display format (Figure 17; Table 12, Information representation), and dimensionality design options (Figure 17) can be attributed to the different information needs and work environments of different clinical roles (Table 10, User cognition; Table 10, When/where). Nurses tended to prefer explanations that were static (i.e., had minimal information to process) and had explanation units organized by assessment (i.e., 83 organized by controllability) (Figure 17). They found the tornado plots easier to understand than the force plots, and preferred simpler explanations (i.e., “The less you have to do the better”). These preferences all align with nurses’ goal to extract actionable information (Table 10, Learning) within the cognitive and time constraints of their work environment (Table 10, Cognitive and time resources). On the other hand, physicians tended to prefer explanations that were modifiable (i.e., could provide more information upon request), which aligns with their desire to gain insights about a patient condition (i.e., using the model as an investigative tool). Physicians demonstrated no clear trend for explanation display format or explanation unit organization (Figure 17), which could simply be attributed to differences in how individual physicians prefer to process information. Explanations that fit the preferences of each clinical role contributed to positive perceptions of usability. In addition to the design elements already noted to influence perceptions of usability, participants suggested some improvements to the design to increase the perceived usability. Specifically, participants utilized the plots of raw time-series data so frequently in interpreting explanation features that they requested multiple plots to view and compare data. They also requested that the points used to create features (e.g., min, max, most recent) be highlighted on the plots. Due to the importance of the baseline risk of mortality in interpreting the predicted risk, participants suggested that the it be more prominently displayed (e.g., above the predicted risk of mortality). To facilitate efficient data exploration, participants wanted data to be linked across interface elements (Table 12, Dimensionality) so that a selection of a data element (e.g., a laboratory test) in the explanation plot or raw feature table would auto-populate the time-series data plots with the selected data element. Finally, participants noted that comments on the vocabulary and visualization used suggested some possible influences on usability (Table 12, 84 Information representation). Specifically, participants noted a desire for simpler terminology for trend-based features (e.g., “Cr has increased since min value” rather than “Cr change from min >0.35”) and visualizations that obeyed standard information processing procedures. For example, the force plot was considered confusing because the increasing predictors were on the right and the largest increasing predictor was to the far right, violating standard ‘left to right’ reading procedures. Additionally, the scroll option on the explanation plot did not have a standard icon and some participants did not know that they could scroll to view additional predictors. 5.3 Final User-centered Explanation Design Based on the insights in section 5.2, I proposed a final user-centered explanation design to be used in an evaluation study with target users. As nurses found more utility in risk trends than individual risk predictions with explanations, the proposed explanation design is intended to be used by physicians in assessing patient condition and priority. I leave exploration for the optimal presentation of model information to nurses for future work. Based on the insights from 5.2, I chose the following design options to maximize physician perceptions of the credibility, utility, and usability of the system: 1) Unit of explanation—feature groups for the initial display, where contributions of individual features for each time-series variable are aggregated by influence (e.g., whether they increase/decrease risk). Feature groups have an interactive hover-box option to view individual features comprising each group. In the interactive hover-box, trend-based features were summarized by whether they were an increasing or decreasing trend. 85 2) Organization of explanation units—default view of a single plot with explanation organized by decreasing magnitude of influence and increasing/decreasing risks grouped together by feature group. Interactive options were included to show groups of explanation units in the single plot by influence on risk or assessment type. 3) Risk representation—risks represented as probabilities expressed as percentages. The baseline risk was moved to a more prominent display location. 4) Explanation display format—tornado plot. While the mixed preferences of physicians for tornado and force plots would suggest that an interactive option to control explanation display format would also be beneficial, I opted not to include this option as some participants had found the force plot confusing to interpret. 5) Dimensionality—in addition to the interactive options to control the unit of explanation and the organization of explanation units mentioned above, the scroll option on the explanation plots was included to allow control over the number of explanation units viewed. Per the insights in section 5.2, the explanation design included the table of raw feature values as well as two plots to display raw values of time-series data that highlighted the points used to generate features. As most relevant contextual information (e.g., diagnoses, interventions) requested by participants would be readily available in the EHR in which a system like this would be embedded, it was not included in the explanation design to reduce the amount of information presented on a single screen. For the evaluation study, relevant contextual information was provided in banner bar and a separate information tab (see Chapter 6). The final explanation design is shown in Figure 19. 86 Figure 19. Final user-centered explanation design. The predicted risk and baseline risk are displayed at the top of the figure. The explanation plot (top left) uses feature groups as the explanation unit, but has hover-box capability to view individual features within each feature group. The plot includes interactive controls to view additional predictors and view sets of feature groups (e.g., view laboratory test feature groups). The raw feature table (bottom left) includes the description, value, and contribution to the risk for each individual feature. This table also includes the trend direction for trend-based features. The plots to display raw values for time-series features (right) highlight the points used to compute features and include interactive controls to zoom in on regions of data. These plots also have a hover funtionality that can be used to show the value and time of specific point. To facilitate data exploration, interactivity is linked across plots and tables (e.g., selecting a predictor on the explanation plot will highlight it in the raw feature table and load the appropriate laboratory test/vital sign in the time-series plot). 87 6.0 Evaluation This chapter describes the evaluation of the user-centered explanation design for the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model that was described in Section 5.3. I conducted a laboratory study with healthcare providers to assess the impact of the user-centered explanation design on provider decision-making and perceptions of the model. Specifically, I examined the use of the model in assisting healthcare providers as they reviewed patient information in preparation for patient rounds. In this scenario, it was hypothesized that the prediction model with explanations could assist a healthcare provider in assessing patient condition and preparing to discuss a patient case with the rounding team. More specifically, when compared with the prediction model without explanations and having no prediction model, I hypothesized that the prediction model with the user-centered explanation design would improve healthcare provider: 1) accuracy in identifying patients who need to be seen urgently and in selecting relevant information to discuss with the rounding team 2) self-reported confidence in identifying patients who need to be seen urgently 3) efficiency in reviewing patient cases Additionally, I hypothesized that relative to the prediction model without explanations, the prediction model with the user-centered explanation design would improve healthcare provider perceptions of the performance expectancy and effort expectancy of using the model in clinical practice. 88 6.1 Materials and Methods This section describes the patient cases and participants, study design and tasks, data collection procedures, and data analyses for the laboratory study. The University of Pittsburgh IRB determined that this study was not considered human subjects research (STUDY19050287). 6.1.1 Participants and Patient Cases A senior pediatric ICU attending selected six patient cases from the test dataset described in section 4.1.1 to be utilized in the laboratory study. Three cases included patients who needed to be seen urgently and three cases included patients who did not need to be seen urgently. The patient cases were selected to be clinically different such that independence of patient case could be assumed when performing data analyses. A convenience sample of healthcare providers was recruited through professional connections of one of the dissertation committee members. Specifically, senior residents, fellows, and junior attending physicians (<1-year experience) specializing in critical care medicine were recruited to participate in the study. These groups were targeted because they were experienced in preparing for rounds on pediatric ICU patients. 6.1.2 Study Design and Tasks I conducted a mixed-methods, within-subject evaluation study with three experimental conditions: 1) no access to information from the prediction model (“no model”), 2) access to model inputs and predictions from the prediction model (“prediction only”), and 3) access to 89 predictions and user-centered explanations from the prediction model (“explanation”). To conduct the evaluation study, I developed a local web-browser application that participants used to complete study tasks. The application is described in Section 6.1.3. Figure 20 provides an overview of the study design and tasks. Sessions were conducted with individual participants and lasted approximately 90 minutes. All sessions took place from September 2019-November 2019 and were conducted in a conference room near the participant’s place of employment. Figure 20. Overview of evaluation study design and tasks Study sessions began with the participant watching a PowerPoint video presentation introducing them to the study objectives, the prediction model, and the study application. The slide deck from the video is provided in Appendix D. After the slideshow, participants were logged into the study application and asked to complete a short background questionnaire about their clinical experience. They were then provided access to a practice patient case that included mortality risk predictions accompanied by the user-centered explanation design and given time to familiarize themselves with the study application and ask any questions. Each participant was then asked to review each of the six patient cases, pretending as though they were preparing for patient rounds. For each case, participants were provided with a case vignette, diagnosis information, and access to laboratory test and vital sign results. Participants were also provided with one of three 90 different displays corresponding to the three experimental conditions: 1) “no model”, which provided no additional information on the patient (Figure 21 in section 6.1.3), 2) “prediction only”, which included a mortality risk prediction with model inputs but no explanation (Figure 22 in section 6.1.3), and 3) “explanation”, which provided a mortality risk prediction accompanied by the user-centered explanation design described in section 5.3 (Figure 19 in section 5.3). Displays were randomly assigned to patient cases such that each participant reviewed two cases (one urgent, one non-urgent) with each one of the three displays. Participants reviewed each patient case only once, and patient cases were shown in a random order. For each patient case, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire corresponding to the following tasks: 1) select the information they feel would influence changes in the plan of care for the patient (i.e., information they would want to present/discuss with the rounding team); 2) decide if the patient needs to be seen urgently by a member of the care team; 3) rate their confidence in the decision; and 4) provide a brief free-text rationale for the decision. After submitting the case response form participants were asked to verbally present their assessment of the patient as if they were presenting to the rounding team. After reviewing all six patient cases, participants were asked to complete subjective assessments of the “prediction only” and “explanation” displays, which included completing a subset of the UTAUT construct scale38 item questionnaire to assess the performance expectancy and effort expectancy of each of the displays (see section 1.2 for a discussion on the relevance of these constructs). Participants were also offered the chance to provide unstructured feedback on each display during the subjective assessments. Copies of the background questionnaire, patient case questionnaire, and UTAUT questionnaires are provided in Appendix E. 91 6.1.3 Study Application To conduct the evaluation study, a local web-browser application was developed that would track participant progress on tasks, allow participants to interactively explore patient case information, and automate the data collection process. Each participant was assigned a unique login and password to access the study application. After logging in, participants were brought to a home page (Appendix D, slide 5) where they could track their progress on each of the study tasks. As shown in Figure 21, each patient case contained: 1) a banner bar providing basic demographic information about the patient; 2) a case information tab containing a case vignette, admitting diagnosis information, and access to plots to view laboratory test and vital sign data; and 3) a responses tab where they could complete the patient case questionnaire. This information was all that was provided for the “no model” display option. Figure 21. “No model” display that contains information available for every patient case 92 When participants had access to information from the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model, they were provided with an additional tab that contained information related to either the “predictions only” display, which is shown in Figure 22, or the “explanation” display, which is shown in Figure 19 in section 5.3. For each participant and patient case, the application recorded time-stamped interactions with interface elements (e.g., tabs, plots, tables). Figure 22. “Predictions only” display with additional tab containing mortality risk information The application was developed in Python 3, utilizing the Python packages Flask version 1.0.2,130 bokeh version 1.1.0,127 shap version 0.28.5,126 WTForms version 2.2.1,131 and SQLAlchemy version 1.3.3.132 Flask is a Python-based web framework that formed the backend of the application and was responsible for processing user input and producing the correct output (i.e., correctly routing user requests, processing input from forms). By default, Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which facilitates dynamic HTML pages. The Flask extension for the popular Bootstrap front-end framework was used to style the HTML in a consistent manner. The bokeh 93 package was used to generate the interactive data displays used in the interface, i.e., the time-series plots for labs/vitals, the explanation plot, and the predictor tables. To collect responses from participants, the Flask extension for the WTForms Python library was used. The shap package was used to pre-generate patient explanations for each of the patient cases and all patient case data was stored within a local SQLite database. The Flask extension for the SQLAlchemy package was used to access the SQLite database to retrieve data, record responses, and track interface interactions. 6.1.4 Data Collection Table 13 summarizes the data collected for each study task. It should be noted that the original scale items for the key UTAUT constructs in the subjective assessment task (performance expectancy, effort expectancy) were experimentally selected from the scale items of constructs from other models of technology acceptance and use (called root constructs). Only a few scale items were originally selected for each key construct and not all scale items were relevant to assess in the context of the proposed experiment (e.g., performance expectancy scale item of “If I use the system, I will increase my chances of getting a raise”). Therefore, for each key construct, I selected a set of scale items from each respective root construct that were relevant to assess in the context of the proposed experiment. 94 Table 13. Data collected for each study task Study Task Data Collected Background Questionnaire  Current clinical position (e.g., resident)  Length of time in current position (e.g., <1 year) Patient Case Review Data collected for each patient case:  Time-stamped interactions with application interface (e.g., tab selections, lab tests viewed)  List of information selected to discuss during rounds  Urgency decision accuracy (see Figure 20)  Urgency decision confidence, rated from 1—not confident at all to 5—extremely confident  Free-text rationale for urgency decision  Time (in seconds) to review patient case (excludes verbal case presentation, see Figure 20)  Audio-recording of verbal patient case presentation  Moderator notes on interesting comments or behavior during case review Subjective Assessments Data collected for “prediction only” and “explanation” displays:  Selected UTAUT Root Construct Scale Items for Performance Expectancy38 (Likert scale agreement): 1.

I would find the system useful in my job.  Selected UTAUT Root Construct Scale Items for Effort Expectancy38 (Likert scale agreement): 1. My interaction with the system would be clear and understandable. 2. I would find the system easy to use. 3. It would be easy for me to become skillful at using the system.  Free-text feedback on the display (optional) 6.1.5 Data Analysis Audio recordings of all verbal case presentations were transcribed verbatim and compiled with urgency decision rationales and moderator notes for each case. Answers to background questionnaires were summarized in a contingency table. Based on the background questionnaire responses, two levels of clinical experience (residents and fellow/attendings) were defined for use in analyses. Primary outcomes of interest included the impact of the user-centered explanation display on decision accuracy, decision confidence, case review efficiency, and provider perceptions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. Analyses for each outcome are summarized in Table 14 and described in the next few sections. P-values of <0.05 were considered 95 significant for all statistical analyses, which were carried out using Stata version 15.133 Plots were generated using the Python packages seaborn version 0.9.0134 and matplotlib version 3.0.3.135 Table 14.

To evaluate urgency decision accuracy, the proportion of correct decisions with 95% CIs for each of the three displays were calculated and a logistic mixed effects analysis of the relationship between urgency decision accuracy and display was performed. Display, case urgency (urgent, non-urgent), and participant experience (resident, attending/fellow) were included as fixed effects in the model (no interaction terms), and an intercept for participant was included as a random effect in the model. To assess accuracy in selecting relevant information, participant 96 precision and recall in selecting ‘relevant’ items were calculated, where information items selected by a senior pediatric ICU attending using the “explanations” display served as the gold standard. Precision and recall scores for each display were visualized using violin plots. Decision urgency rationales, case presentation transcripts, and moderator notes were reviewed for mentions of the predictive model tool and to assist in interpretation of the results. Analysis of decision confidence To assess the relationship between the display shown and participant-reported confidence in their urgency decision, confidence ratings for each of the displays were visualized in a stacked bar chart and an ordinal logistic mixed effects analysis was performed. Display, case urgency (urgent, non-urgent), and participant experience (resident, attending/fellow) were included as fixed effects in the model (no interaction terms), and an intercept for participant was included as a random effect in the model. Decision urgency rationales, case presentation transcripts, and moderator notes were reviewed for mentions of the predictive model tool and to assist in interpretation of the results. Analysis of case review efficiency Case review efficiency consisted of the time it took participants to review each patient case and the amount of information being viewed, which was measured by the number of items (e.g., lab test, vital sign) viewed during the case. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the case review time, number of unique items viewed, and the total number of items viewed. To assess the relationship between the display shown and case review time, a log-linear mixed effects analysis was performed after it was determined that case review time followed a log-normal distribution. 97 To assess the relationship between the display shown and the number of unique items viewed, a Poisson mixed effects analysis was performed. To assess the relationship between the display shown and the total number of items viewed, a negative binomial mixed effects analysis was performed after it was determined that the distribution of the total number of items was over-dispersed (mean=33.0; variance=206.3). For all three models, display, case urgency (urgent, non-urgent), participant experience (resident, attending/fellow), and case order (i.e., the order in which the case was seen by a participant) were included as fixed effects (no interaction terms) and an intercept for participant was included as a random effect. Analysis of provider perceptions Responses to the UTAUT scale items for the “explanation” and “prediction only” displays were visualized and compared using stacked bar charts. Free-text feedback on displays and moderator notes were qualitatively reviewed to assist in the interpretation of the UTAUT questionnaire responses and to identify additional insights about participant perceptions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model and the displays. 6.2 Results A total of 15 participants were recruited for this study. Responses to the background questionnaire on clinical experience are summarized in Table 15. As per the study design, each participant reviewed and provided responses for 6 patient cases. Due to a technical error, one participant failed to successfully complete one of their assigned cases. Thus, there were a total of 89 participant responses for the patient cases. The breakdown of case responses by display and 98 case urgency is shown in Table 16. In 6.2.1-6.2.3, I describe the results from the analyses on decision accuracy and confidence, case review efficiency, and provider perceptions of the model, respectively. Table 15.

The results of the logistic mixed effects analysis (Table 18) detected no significant effect of display, case urgency, or participant experience on decision accuracy. As seen in Figure 23, neither the precision nor recall scores revealed discernable differences in provider accuracy in selecting relevant patient information. 99 Table 17.

Participant accuracy in selecting relevant information. The plots show the distributions of precision (left) and recall (right) scores for each of the three displays. As seen in Figure 24, participants seemed confident in their urgency decisions regardless of display, with all providers rating their confidence as a 3 or higher for all decisions. While Figure 24 suggests that providers might be more confident in their decisions when they had access to a mortality risk prediction (“predictions only” and “explanation” displays), the ordinal logistic mixed effects analysis (Table 18) detected no significant effect of display, case urgency, or participant experience on decision confidence. The lack of display impact on decision accuracy and confidence is further supported by the fact that decision rationales and case presentations contained relatively few mentions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model (six total mentions by four different participants). When mentioned, participants were either questioning the 100 validity of a model prediction with the “prediction only” display (e.g., “mortality risk is lower, but it looks like a lot of things are kind of trending in the ‘not right’ direction”) or using the mortality risk prediction from either the “prediction only” or “explanation” display as part of their justification for the urgency decision (“a child who is under-supported with a high risk of mortality”).

The analyses did reveal a significant effect of case urgency on case review time and the unique number of items viewed (Table 20 and Table 21). More specifically, when controlling for other factors, participants spent a longer time reviewing a case and viewed more unique items for urgent cases when compared to non-urgent cases. The analyses also revealed a significant effect of the order in which the case was seen by a participant on case review time and the total number of items viewed (Table 20 and Table 21). More specifically, when controlling for other factors, participants spent less time per case and viewed less total items per case as they progressed through the set of six patient cases, i.e., participants became more efficient in their case review as they went through the study tasks.

In general, participants had positive perceptions of the performance expectancy of a system utilizing either the “prediction only” or “explanation” display (Figure 25, statements 1-4), but the “explanation” display improved participant perceptions of performance expectancy relative to the “prediction only” display. More specifically, a majority of participants thought that a system utilizing the “explanation” display would be useful in their job (93%), make it easier to do their job (73%), and increase their productivity (60%) (Figure 25, statements 1-3). In contrast, less than half of participants reported the same thoughts about the “prediction only” display (33%, 33%, and 46%, respectively). Several participants mentioned that a system without explanations would not be useful to them, specifically because they could not rationalize the prediction and identify why the patient might be at higher or lower risk. Participant comments indicated that the positive perceptions of the performance expectancy of the “prediction only” display were related to the benefit of having a mortality risk score to help in patient prioritization. One participant specifically commented on their positive ratings for the “prediction only” display: “Both systems are already markedly better than our current electronic medical record (thus I marked all as strongly agree).” —2nd year fellow 104 Figure 25. Participant responses to UTAUT questionnaire for “prediction only” and “explanation” displays. Statements 1-4 assess perceptions of performance expectancy and statements 5-7 assess perceptions of effort expectancy. Despite the generally positive views of performance expectancy, only 40% of participants reported that a system utilizing either display would enable them to accomplish tasks more quickly (Figure 25, statement 4). Comments from participants revealed that this perception may have been partially influenced by having to adjust to unfamiliar data displays for laboratory test and vital sign data. In particular, a few participants commented that it took them longer to find and review raw data than it would have taken them in the EHR (e.g., having to look up each individual component of a basic metabolic panel), which could have negatively impacted participant perceptions of the system’s ability to help them accomplish tasks more quickly. Moreover, although some participants thought the system would help them more efficiently assess a patient’s condition, many participants seemed not to trust the system as a guide, viewing it instead as a tool to confirm 105 their own assessments. This view might explain why participants felt the system would not aid them in accomplishing tasks more quickly. One participant succinctly summarized this viewpoint: “The explanations certainly help me dive under the black-box nature of the model without explanations, but I don’t think it would dramatically improve my productivity. At this point, I would still want to evaluate each feature using my standard process, then look at the model to see if I missed anything, rather than using the model as a hypothesis generator. There were features that I was much more concerned about than the model, and vice versa, that builds inherent distrust.” —2nd year fellow Overall, the “explanation” display greatly improved participant perceptions of effort expectancy relative to the “prediction only” display (Figure 25, statements 5-7). While some participants reported positive perceptions of the effort expectancy of the “prediction only” display, a large number of participants commented that the explanations greatly improved their ability to make sense of the risk prediction. Several participants commented that the information in the “prediction only” display was overwhelming and not helpful in understanding the prediction. One participant specifically noted his frustration with the “prediction only” display when he disagreed with a high risk prediction, commenting that the provided information did not help him understand why the model was showing an increased risk. Many participants expressed preference for the “explanation” display, stating that the explanation facilitated model interpretation and comparison with their own clinical judgment. One participant effectively summarized these ideas: “[The ‘prediction only’ display made it] nearly impossible to tell what the key factors were—I’m simply drowning in the computer’s output without a framework to make sense of it…[It’s] very helpful to graphically demonstrate key drivers that the machine found important—it allowed me to integrate the machine’s understanding with my own clinical intuition and knowledge of the patient’s overall context, which I fear may be missed by a machine-learning model at times.” —2nd year resident 106 In addition to clarifying perceptions about the model and displays, participant comments and feedback identified a few possible design improvements for the “explanation” display. First, as already mentioned above, participant comments suggested that it may be beneficial to present laboratory test and vital sign data in the same format it is presented in the EHR (e.g., a fishbone diagram for basic metabolic panel data). Additionally, for the laboratory test and vital sign data views, participants requested: 1) the ability to plot multiple tests on the same plot, 2) ‘quick buttons’ to zoom in on relevant time ranges of data (e.g., last 12, 24, or 48 hours); 3) drop-down boxes that allow selection by groups of related results (e.g., electrolytes); 4) the ability to select points to be highlighted (e.g., non-selected points are “greyed out”); and 5) a table or list of current values next to the plot. In addition to feedback on the laboratory and vital sign test views, a few participants suggested improvements to interface interactions (e.g., using arrow keys to navigate a dropdown list) and several participants requested additional information about the patient to assist in their interpretation of the data (e.g., laboratory tests, ventilator settings, interventions). 107 7.0 Discussion In this dissertation, I aimed to utilize clinician perspectives to inform the design of explanations for ML-based prediction tools to improve the adoption of these tools in clinical practice. Toward that goal, I developed a new theoretical framework of explanation design for ML models and used the framework in conjunction with healthcare provider feedback to inform the design of a user-centered explanation for predictions from a pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. The user-centered explanation design was a model-agnostic, instance-level explanation of feature influence generated using the publicly available SHAP algorithm.124,125 I hypothesized that the predictive model with the user-centered explanation design would improve provider perceptions of utilizing the predictive model in practice, which would result in the predictive model improving provider accuracy, confidence, and efficiency in making decisions during preparations for patient rounds relative to having no model and having a model that does not provide explanations. While the results of the studies demonstrated that the user-centered explanation design improved provider perceptions of utilizing the predictive model in practice, no significant effect of the user-centered explanation design on decision-making accuracy, confidence, or efficiency was observed. Overall, the results of the studies revealed that critical care providers had positive perceptions of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model and the user-centered explanation design. In the qualitative inquiry study, providers found the mock-ups of the SHAP explanations useful in assessing the credibility and utility of a prediction from the model, (i.e., comparing the influential risk factors to domain knowledge to determine if the prediction seemed reasonable and clinically relevant). In the evaluation study, the user-centered design of the SHAP explanations 108 greatly improved provider perceptions of the performance expectancy and effort expectancy of using the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model in practice. These findings suggest that model-agnostic, instance-level, explanation approaches based on feature influence methods are a viable approach to explaining model predictions in a way that is both comprehensible and useful to healthcare providers. Although other studies have utilized these approaches to explain predictive models in healthcare,10,16,75 to the best of my knowledge this is the first study to verify that these explanations would be positively received by healthcare providers. Provider acceptance of these explanations could help overcome the model interpretability barrier to utilizing ML models in practical applications in medicine. It should be noted that concerns about model interpretability as a barrier to adoption generally come after an ML model has been demonstrated to have acceptable performance, generalizability, and/or reproducibility (i.e., once a “good” model has been developed). However, model interpretability can assist model developers in ensuring these criteria are met. These criteria were considered outside the scope of the conducted studies, but are important to note in discussions of the value of interpretability when utilizing predictive models in healthcare. Although providers indicated that they would accept and use the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model, the evaluation study revealed no significant effects of the model with the user-centered explanation display on decision-making accuracy, confidence, or efficiency, which was unexpected. However, the study was likely under-powered to detect effects in these outcomes, unless the effect size was very large. For example, let’s consider the comparison of decision accuracy in only the “no model” and “explanation” display groups, where there would ideally be a total of 60 observations (30 in each group). Assuming the true proportion of correct responses in the “no model” display group was 0.68 (from Table 17) and assuming a total 60 observations (30 109 per group), for a chi-square test to detect a statistically significant effect at an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, the proportion of correct responses in the “explanation” display group would have had to have been 0.95 or higher. Similarly, treating the other outcomes as continuous and comparing only the “no model” and “explanation” display groups, a paired t-test with a total sample size of 60 (30 in each group), an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 80% would be able to detect an effect size of 0.74. Assuming the lowest standard deviation for each efficiency measure in Table 19 and a standard deviation of 0.5 for decision confidence, this would be a minimal difference of ~3 minutes in case review time, ~2 items in the number of unique items viewed, ~7 items in the number of total items viewed, and 0.37 points in decision confidence. In light of these analyses, it is less surprising that the study did not detect any significant effect of the user-centered explanation display on decision-making outcomes. The analyses did detect significant effects of case urgency and the order in which a case was viewed on the decision efficiency metrics. Specifically, providers spent significantly more time reviewing a case and viewed significantly more unique items for urgent cases than for non-urgent cases. This was not surprising to find, as the urgent cases represented more medically complex patients and would likely require more review time by providers. It was surprising to find that providers spent significantly less time and reviewed significantly fewer total items for cases that were viewed later in the study session. This could have been because providers were still spending time to familiarize themselves with system after the practice patient case. Alternatively, the study sessions may have been too short to allow adequate time for providers to review all of the patient cases, which may have caused them to rush through the material as they neared the end of the session. This suggests that there was a learning curve required to use the system that was not adequately accounted for, which may have obscured the effect the shown display had on 110 measures of decision efficiency. Two possible ways in which the learning curve effect could have been better controlled include: 1) running pilot studies to estimate the time it would take participants to complete each study task and planning sessions of adequate length, and 2) developing a way to assess participants’ comfort level with the system and requiring that they reach a predefined level of comfort during the practice patient case activity. In contrast to the quantitative analyses, the subjective assessments of the performance expectancy of the systems suggested that providers would find the predictive model with explanations beneficial in performing their jobs, indicating that the tool would provide some benefit to decision-making. Two main viewpoints emerged about the benefit of the tool in decision-making. Some providers saw the tool as a confirmatory tool, i.e., a tool to confirm thought processes and check for things that they might have missed during their initial assessment. This viewpoint agrees with findings from Jeffery et al.,136 who found that nurses mainly viewed probability-based CDSSs as a tool to confirm their thoughts about a patient, and Hallen et al.,95 who found that providers perceived clinical prediction models as tools to improve their prognostic confidence. This would suggest that providers view predictive models as confirmatory tools to increase decision confidence, rather than as informatory tools to guide decisions. If used as a confirmatory tool, the system would have minimal impact on provider decision-making processes, which would partially explain the lack of observed effect on decision-making accuracy and efficiency and likely explains participants’ generally low expectations that the tool would improve their ability to accomplish tasks quickly. The second viewpoint about the benefit of the tool relates to decision efficiency. In particular, some participants viewed the predictive model with explanations as a useful tool to guide their assessment of patients and to prioritize patients. More specifically, by highlighting 111 patients and information of concern, providers thought the tool could help them be more efficient in prioritizing patients and reviewing patient information. This viewpoint likely explains the few participants who perceived the tool as something that would improve their ability to accomplish tasks quickly. Interestingly, the same number of participants reported that the “prediction only” and “explanation” display would improve their ability to accomplish tasks quickly. This suggests that the perceived improvement in task efficiency may stem from having a mortality risk prediction to help them prioritize patients, regardless of whether the prediction is accompanied by an explanation. This view can explain the positive perceptions of the performance expectancy observed for the “prediction only” display as the system was still providing new information to the participants, even though the system was less favorably perceived than the “explanation” display. This viewpoint contradicts past experiences in which high performing models have gone unused due to lack of interpretability, which suggests that user and environmental characteristics likely influence the types of predictive model systems that may be accepted and used. Despite some participants’ favorable perception of the performance expectancy of the “prediction only” display system, provider feedback on the system demonstrated that the “explanation” display system had higher performance expectancy and a much lower effort expectancy. Specifically, providers found that the explanations simplified interpretation of the risk prediction from the model and integration of the model information with their clinical knowledge. Several participants mentioned that they would not use the system without the explanations, particularly because they could not investigate predictions that surprised them. Although the benefit of providing explanations could not be demonstrated quantitatively, the subjective assessments and provider feedback suggest that it is still valuable to provide the explanations for the predictive risk model. 112 The discrepancy between the results of the subjective assessments of provider perceptions of the model and the quantitative analyses of the impact on decision-making raise several thoughts about the study and how to measure the potential value of a predictive model in clinical practice. First, it suggests that the study possibly targeted the wrong outcome metrics to assess the impact of the predictive model with explanations on provider decision-making. The provider view that the system would be useful in assessing and prioritizing patients suggests that perhaps the value of the tool is in comparing urgency levels of patients rather than assessing the urgency level of an individual patient, (i.e., making decisions about groups of patients rather than individual patients). If this is the case, the study missed an opportunity to examine the impact of the predictive model with explanations on an important decision-making process. Conducting a more thorough investigation of how the tool would be used in practice could have helped identify the appropriate decision-making process and outcomes to assess in the evaluation study. Alternatively, it is possible that the study examined the right decision-making process, but the predictive model with explanations did not provide information that would directly influence provider decisions. This is supported by the provider view that the system was useful as a confirmatory tool and could increase decision confidence, but would not directly influence a decision. Shah et al.5 suggest that many predictive models are not deployed into practice because they do not provide information that influence decisions. This would suggest that a predictive model tool would need to demonstrate a clear benefit on decision-making performance to be accepted in practice, but the results of the evaluation study showed that providers would still use and accept a tool even if it did not directly inform decision-making. Dekker et al.137 mention that access to accurate risk predictions seems to have an unpredictable effect on provider decisions and thus claim that the true value of a predictive model tool cannot be known without running impact 113 studies to assess the effect on patient outcomes. This raises several interesting questions about how to evaluate predictive model tools for use in clinical practice. Specifically, what are the appropriate metrics and assessments for demonstrating the value of a predictive model tool? What evidence of the value of a predictive model tool should be required before it is deployed into clinical practice? If a predictive model does not demonstrate improved performance in some measureable way, do subjective assessments of provider satisfaction with the tool provide enough evidence of its value? These questions warrant further consideration as more predictive model tools make their way into clinical practice. More generally, this work contributes to knowledge about the effective communication of predictive model risk information to healthcare providers. In both the qualitative inquiry and evaluation studies, it was found that providers liked the ability to visually assess which risk factors were contributing most to an individual’s predicted risk. This finding provides evidence to support claims in the literature that visualizations of risk information for individuals can improve healthcare provider interpretation and acceptance of predictive models.96,113 Additionally, results from the study revealed that providing the appropriate contextual information was vital to provider interpretation of risk. In particular, access to raw patient data (e.g., laboratory values, vital signs, interventions) played a significant role in provider ability to assess the clinical credibility and utility of predictions and explanations. This finding is consistent with results from studies by Wang et al.40 and Jeffery et al.,136 both of whom also found that providers utilized raw patient data when working with probability-based decision support systems to verify information from the system and integrate it with their clinical knowledge. In addition to raw patient data, several nurses in the qualitative inquiry study noted the importance of having a baseline risk and risk trends to assess the clinical relevance of a risk prediction. More specifically, a change in risk from a patient- 114 specific or population baseline was deemed more clinically relevant than a single risk prediction. This finding is consistent with results from Jeffrey et al.,136 who also found that nurses wanted to see risk trends when using probability-based CDSS. While most research has focused on developing high-performing risk prediction models, these findings suggest the need for more research on how the manner in which risk information is communicated affects provider interpretation and use of the information in clinical practice. The studies also revealed that interactive explanations of risk were beneficial to supporting different user information needs and preventing information overload by allowing users to ask for additional details when desired. Allowing users to ask for more information from the system improved participant perceptions of the system, which provides some support for claims that effective explanations for AI systems would mimic human explanation and occur as part of a social interaction or conversation.27 Providing interactive explanations would also facilitate inclusion of multiple explanation types into a single explanation display, such as incorporating the “what if” type explanations that some participants requested during the qualitative inquiry study. While this type of explanation was not incorporated in the final design, an interactive explanation could support the inclusion of the additional type (e.g., adding interactive features to the SHAP explanation that allow users to change model inputs to see the change in predicted risk). The need for integrating multiple explanation types into a single explanation design has also been mentioned by Wang et al.,40 who found that providers utilized a variety of different explanations to support various reasoning processes when diagnosing patients. The proposed theoretical framework in this work could support further exploration of how to design combinations of explanations that effectively support healthcare provider explanation needs in various tasks. 115 While this work advocates the need for user-centered explanation designs for predictive models in healthcare, one could argue that there may be scenarios in which explanations are not required at all. For example, if a model was hypothetically able to achieve perfect performance on a prediction task, explanations might be considered unnecessary. Alternatively, explanations might be considered unnecessary when it is obvious whether the model correctly predicts the outcome (e.g., image classifications that can be verified by visual inspection). In either of these scenarios, one could argue that explanations might still be needed to instill user trust in the model (i.e., a user may want to ensure that predictions can be justified based on domain knowledge). However, Elish24 contradict this argument by pointing out that trust in a model can also be built by involving stakeholders throughout the model development process. Even if global explanations of a model are considered unnecessary, instance-level explanations could still provide valuable information to a user that enables them to act on a specific prediction. For example, consider a model that perfectly predicts a patient’s risk of mortality. There are several different ways in which a patient may die and the ability of a provider to intervene will depend on the reason a patient is predicted to die. Thus, instance-level explanations may still prove valuable for the perfectly performing model. Although it is likely that some form of explanation will be required for most predictive models in healthcare, the need for explanations will be context-dependent and should be discussed in the early stages of model development. 7.1 Limitations and Future Work The main limitation of this work was in the evaluation study design, specifically the small sample size and the insufficient study session length, which likely negatively impacted the ability 116 to detect any significant effect of the explanation design on decision-making outcomes. Additionally, it appears that the overall system design did not adequately represent the context in which the predictive model might be used in clinical practice. More specifically, the predictive model system was not presented as a tool integrated into the existing EHR, which is how the model would likely be presented to providers when deployed into practice. As noted by participant comments and feedback on the system, this presented issues due to lack of access to certain patient data (e.g., interventions) and unfamiliar data presentations (e.g., laboratory and vital sign plots). The lack of contextual information and unfamiliar data displays likely negatively impacted measures of the decision-making metrics, specifically decision efficiency. It may have also negatively impacted provider perceptions of the tool’s ability to help them accomplish tasks quickly. Additionally, as discussed above, it is possible that the evaluation study targeted the wrong decision-making process, or at least did not consider the full complexity of how providers might use the predictive model information to aid in decision-making. As the main focus was to examine the value of explanations, model information was only presented for single predictions and providers made decisions about individual patient cases. However, as noted by nurses in the qualitative inquiry study, risk trend information was considered useful in assessing changes in risk and was perceived as having higher clinical utility than single risk predictions. Moreover, physicians mentioned that the system would be useful in prioritizing patients, which suggests that an overview of risk predictions for a group of patients may be helpful in making prioritization decisions about patient groups. Because the system did not include risk trends or overviews of risk predictions for groups of patients, a vital piece of how the predictive model system might be used to make decisions in the clinical setting may have been missed. Finally, it’s possible that the 117 evaluation metrics used in the evaluation study did not capture how explanations of predictive models might impact decision-making. While accuracy, confidence, and efficiency are obvious metrics to assess improved decision-making, it’s possible that explanations of predictive models improve decision-making in subtler ways. Examples of alternative metrics of improved decision-making could include: 1) provider shared decision-making performance (e.g., explanations could facilitate conversations with patients that lead to better shared decision-making); 2) amount of information incorporated into a decision (e.g., explanations could prompt providers to view more patient information prior to making a decision, which could be viewed as beneficial as they would rely less on heuristic decision-making); and 3) effort required to make decisions (e.g., explanations may reduce cognitive effort required by providers to make decisions). Some of these metrics may be challenging to measure (e.g., shared-decision making performance138), but are worth considering for inclusion in future studies evaluating the potential impact of predictive model systems. Despite the aforementioned limitations, provider perceptions of the predictive model with explanations were generally positive, indicating that they would accept and use the system in practice. These positive perceptions warrant further exploration of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model with explanations to address some of the limitations and unanswered questions. Specifically, I would propose designing a system that presents the predictive model with the user-centered explanation as a tool integrated into the existing EHR. The system would incorporate user feedback on the displays of the supporting information, specifically mimicking the familiar EHR displays for laboratory test and vital sign data and incorporating the other suggestions for improvement provided by users. It would also include risk trend information for patients and provide overviews of risk predictions for groups or lists of patients. Studies assessing 118 the usability of the system could then be performed to gain a better understanding of how the system information fits into provider workflow and decision-making processes, specifically focusing on the utility of the user-centered explanation design. The combination of a “think-aloud” protocol analysis with “near-live” clinical simulations proposed by Li et al.139 would likely be a good approach for these studies. The “think-aloud” protocol analysis would allow improvement of the usability of the system and give insight into how it might be used in clinical decision-making processes. The “near-live” clinical simulations would provide further information as to how the system could best accommodate clinician workflow and be used in the clinical setting, further elucidating the potential impact of the system on provider decision-making processes and patient outcomes. The results of this study could then be used to inform the design of evaluation studies of system impact. Some other interesting directions for future work are suggested by the two provider viewpoints regarding the benefit of the predictive model with explanations. First, providers who viewed the predictive model as a confirmatory tool exhibited a level of distrust in the system, particularly when the model information contradicted their own knowledge. It is unclear from the study whether this distrust is why some providers view predictive models as confirmatory tools rather than as tools that could guide decision-making. This raises an interesting question as to how provider trust in a predictive modeling system may impact use of the system, and thus affect whether the system has an impact on outcomes. Future studies on how provider perceptions of trust in predictive modeling systems affects use of the system would be of interest. Second, it was interesting to note that some providers viewed the predictive model with explanations as a tool that could improve provider efficiency in prioritizing patients and reviewing patient information. Recent work has demonstrated improvements in patient information review efficiency when using 119 past provider viewing patterns to predict and highlight relevant information in the EHR.140 In light of this work and viewpoint, an interesting future study might be to explore how instance-level explanations of models predicting clinical deterioration in patients could be used to effectively guide clinician review of patient information in the EHR by highlighting information of concern. Another direction for future work arises from the finding that the SHAP explanations enabled providers to suggest ways to improve the clinical credibility and utility of the pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. This suggests that instance-level explanations could be useful communication tools for model developers to incorporate provider feedback and knowledge into models based on ML approaches. This could possibly involve interactive ML approaches in which healthcare providers use instance-level explanations to provide feedback on individual predictions to improve a model. Incorporating healthcare provider feedback and knowledge into models has been shown to improve acceptance of models in practice.23,24 Feedback could be provided in a laboratory setting during model development or in the clinical setting as part of ongoing improvement of a deployed model. These settings would likely require different explanation needs and designs. While it was beyond the scope of this study, future studies could involve applying the theoretical framework to inform the design of explanations that facilitate provider involvement in the development and ongoing improvement of predictive models. A final direction for future work would involve expanding the scope of the proposed theoretical framework. This could include adding components that extend the framework to account for how the use of specific data types or models might influence explanation design and interpretation. For example, to account for the influence of a specific model (assuming a model-agnostic explanation approach is not taken), a component could be added that demonstrates how knowledge of the specific model type (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) would influence 120 why the user might want an explanation as well as the space of possible explanation approaches and design options. Additionally, components could be included to provide more specific design suggestions based on the category of explanation approach (e.g., design options for model-agnostic, instance-level explanations of feature influence). 7.2 Conclusions There is an increasing interest in high-performing predictive models capable of explaining the reasoning behind a prediction in a way that is both comprehensible and useful to healthcare providers. This dissertation aimed to address this need by proposing a new theoretical framework for user-centered explanation design of ML models in healthcare. The proposed framework was utilized in conjunction with healthcare provider feedback to inform the design of a user-centered explanation for predictions from a pediatric ICU in-hospital mortality risk model. While the user-centered explanation design improved provider perceptions of utilizing the predictive model in practice, the predictive model with the user-centered explanation did not demonstrate a significant improvement in provider accuracy, confidence, or efficiency in making decisions. Nonetheless, the work demonstrated that model-agnostic, instance-level, explanation approaches based on feature influence methods are a viable approach to explaining model predictions to healthcare providers. These explanations can be utilized for any model and can help overcome the model interpretability barrier to utilizing high performance ML models in practical applications in medicine. This work also identified several possible areas in which the proposed theoretical framework could be useful in designing explanations. 121 Overall, the work in this dissertation provides meaningful insights into the role of model interpretability and explanation in healthcare and contributes to knowledge on how to effectively communicate ML model information to healthcare providers. It is my hope that insights from this work can facilitate conversations with healthcare providers about the development, deployment, and continuous improvement of ML-based tools that can promote positive changes in clinical practice. 122 Appendix A Descriptions and Comparisons of SHAP and LIME Algorithms This appendix provides a description of the LIME and SHAP algorithms and presents the experiments conducted to select between the two algorithms. Both algorithms generate explanations for a classifier or regressor in the form of feature-importance rankings and were developed to handle a variety of input data types, including image, text, and tabular data. Sections A.1 and A.2 provide an overview of how each algorithm works for a binary classification problem. I focused specifically on tabular data input as this is the most common data format used for risk prediction models in healthcare. Section A.3 presents the experiments conducted to justify the selection of the SHAP algorithm for use in this work. Appendix A.1 Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) The goal of the LIME algorithm123 is to “identify an interpretable model over the interpretable representation that is locally faithful to the classifier”.64 In simple terms, to generate an explanation for a single instance, LIME uses a human-readable representation of classifier inputs (e.g., words instead of word vectors) to learn an interpretable model (e.g., sparse linear regression, short decision tree) that fits the local decision boundary near the instance of interest. Formally, for an instance 𝑥, family of interpretable models 𝐺, original predictive model 𝑓, and proximity measure Π𝑥, an explanation 𝜉(𝑥) can be produced by solving: 𝜉(𝑥) = argmin𝑔∈𝐺ℒ(𝑓, 𝑔, Π𝑥) + Ω(𝑔) (1) 123 where ℒ(𝑓, 𝑔, Π𝑥) provides a measure of how unfaithful the interpretable model 𝑔 is in approximating the original prediction model 𝑓 in the locality defined by Π𝑥, and Ω(𝑔) is a measure of the complexity of interpretable model 𝑔 (e.g., tree depth for decision trees). To approximate ℒ(𝑓, 𝑔, Π𝑥) in a model-agnostic manner, LIME gains an understanding of the local behavior of the original predictive model 𝑓 by generating perturbed samples, obtaining their predictions from 𝑓, and weighting them by their distance from the instance of interest (Π𝑥). Equation 1 can then be optimized to get an explanation by using the new weighted samples to fit an interpretable model that is constrained by the complexity parameter Ω(𝑔). In practice, Ω(𝑔) is a user-specified parameter indicating how many features to include in an explanation. Figure A1 provides a graphic depiction of the LIME approach to generating an explanation for a single instance. Currently, the implementation of LIME only supports explanations in the form of regressions. The exact approach to generating explanations varies by input data type, but an overview of the LIME implementation approach based on tabular data input is provided. Specific details on the implementation approaches for text and image data can be found in the LIME code and documentation.141 The following implementation description is based on the code and documentation for LIME version 0.1.1.31. 124 Figure A1. Graphic overview of the LIME approach to generating explanations. To generate an explanation for an instance of interest (indicated by the bolded red cross), LIME performs the following: 1) generates perturbed samples (all non-bolded points on the plot), 2) obtains their prediction from the classifier (circle or cross), 3) weights them according to distance from the instance of interest (represented here by point size), and 4) uses weighted samples to fit an interpretable model (indicated by the dashed line) that is locally faithful to the original predictive model decision boundary (indicated by the red/blue background). (Image taken directly from Ribeiro et al.123) As indicated in Figure A1, the first step in the LIME explanation process is to generate perturbed data samples. LIME requires training data to perform this step, which is usually the same dataset used to train the predictive model. Numerical features are perturbed by randomly sampling from the standard normal distribution and performing inverse mean centering and scaling using the feature means and standard deviations computed from the training data. Categorical features are perturbed by randomly sampling feature values according to their frequency in the training data, and then creating a binary feature to indicate whether the perturbed value matches the value for the instance being explained (i.e., 1 when the value matches, 0 otherwise). Users can specify the number of perturbed samples to generate for each explanation, but the default for tabular data is 5,000 samples. LIME then uses the original predictive model to obtain the class prediction 125 probabilities for each of the perturbed samples. Each perturbed sample 𝑧 is weighted according to Π𝑥, which is defined as an exponential kernel: Π𝑥(𝑧) = exp (−𝐷(𝑥, 𝑧)2/𝜎2) (2) where 𝐷 and 𝜎 are a user-defined distance metric and kernel width, respectively. If not specified by the user, LIME will use Euclidean distance and a kernel width equal to 75% of the square root of the number of training data features. The weighted perturbed samples are then used to provide an approximation to Equation 1 by first selecting a specified number of features and then learning feature weights via regression. The user has control over the number of features selected, the approach to feature selection, and the type of regression. By default, LIME generates explanations using 10 features, selects features that have the highest product of absolute weight and original data point when learning a linear ridge regression with all features, and uses linear ridge regression with a regularization strength of =1 to learn feature weights for the explanation. Users also have the option of discretizing numeric features in the explanation and are provided several discretization options. By default, LIME discretizes numeric features into quartiles for explanations. As noted above, the implementation of LIME provides control over a variety of algorithm parameters. While this flexibility can be beneficial, the explanations produced can be heavily affected by the choice of these parameters. Defaults are provided for all parameters, but the LIME authors provide little guidance for parameter selection and do not provide justifications for the default settings. 126 Appendix A.2 SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) The SHAP algorithm124,125 aims to unify several local explanation methods into a single approach for interpreting model predictions. It introduces the perspective of “viewing any explanation of a model’s prediction as a model itself”, and calls this model the explanation model.125 Additive feature attribution methods are introduced as a class of explanation models that attribute an effect, 𝜙, to each feature in a model and the sum of these effects approximates the original model prediction. The explanation model is thus defined as a linear function of binary variables: 𝑔(𝑧′) = 𝜙0 + ∑ 𝜙𝑖𝑧𝑖′𝑀𝑖=1 (3) where 𝑧′ is a binary vector of simplified features (e.g., binary vector indicating whether a specific feature was observed or not) of length 𝑀, and 𝑀 represents the number of simplified features. This class of explanation model is used by several instance-level explanation methods, and therefore unifies these methods under a single approach. For specific details on each method and how it fits this class of explanation model, see Lundberg 2017.125 There exists a unique set of values of 𝜙 that ensures this class of explanation models meets three desirable properties: 1) local accuracy/fidelity (i.e., the sum of the attributed feature effects exactly equals the model prediction); 2) missingness (i.e., an absent input feature should have no attributed effect); and 3) consistency (i.e., if input feature always has greater impact in one model over another, then it should be attributed a higher effect for that model). This unique set of values are the Shapley values, a method from cooperative game theory that fairly distributes gains among all players of a collaborative game according to their marginal contributions towards the total gain.142 For an explanation model, the “players” are the features, the “gains” are the effect 127 attributed to each feature, and the explanation model for a prediction, 𝑓(𝑥), can be formally defined as follows: 𝜙𝑖(𝑓, 𝑥) = ∑|𝑆|!(𝑀−|𝑆|−1)!𝑀!𝑆⊆𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙\{𝑖}[𝑓𝑥(𝑆 ∪ {𝑖}) − 𝑓𝑥(𝑆)] (4) where 𝜙𝑖 corresponds to the Shapley value of the 𝑖-th feature, 𝑓 is the original prediction model, 𝑥 is the prediction instance to be explained, 𝑆 is a subset of the set of all features except the 𝑖-th feature, |𝑆| is the number of features in the subset, 𝑀 is the number of simplified input features, and 𝑓𝑥(𝑆) = 𝑓(𝑥𝑆) where 𝑥𝑆 is equal to the values in 𝑥 for features in the set 𝑆 but are considered missing otherwise.75 As many prediction models do not support arbitrary patterns of missing input data, in practice 𝑓𝑥(𝑆) is estimated by computing its expected value on repeated evaluations of 𝑓𝑥(𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑙) where missing values are filled in using randomly selected samples from a training dataset.75 The 𝜙𝑖 of a feature can be interpreted as the change in the expected model prediction that occurs when a feature is observed versus unknown, averaged across all possible subsets and orderings of features. To better clarify the theory and interpretation of the Shapley values produced by the SHAP algorithm, a simple example is provided. Imagine a model that predicts a person’s risk of having the flu based on four features: 1) temperature, 2) presence/absence of a cough, 3) presence/absence of a runny nose, and 4) presence/absence of fatigue. Assume that the model predicts 0.10 probability of having influenza for the average person and the goal is to explain the prediction for a person who has a 0.75 probability in terms of how each of the four features impacts the model’s prediction relative to the average person. Assume that this person has a temperature of 102.3F, presence of a cough, no runny nose, and presence of fatigue. To find the impact of each feature on the prediction, their 𝜙 values must be computed as defined in Equation 4. A walk-through of each part of the calculation of 𝜙 for the presence of fatigue is described below and shown in Figure A2. 128 To calculate 𝜙 for the presence of fatigue, it is first necessary to estimate the marginal contribution of “fatigue = present” for each possible feature subset that can include that feature. For example, consider the last subset depicted in Figure A2 that includes the features “cough = present”, “runny nose = absent”, and “temperature=102.3F”. To estimate the marginal contribution of “fatigue = present” for this subset, model predictions are obtained when this feature value is observed and not observed (i.e., missing). When “fatigue = present” is observed, the model predicts a probability of 0.75. To get an estimate of what the model would predict if the value for fatigue was missing, a value for fatigue is randomly sampled from the training dataset. Assume a randomly sampled value of “fatigue = absent” and a model prediction of 0.60. Several repetitions of this sampling procedure can be performed, and the values can be averaged to obtain a better estimate of the model prediction when fatigue is missing. Assume the estimate after several repetitions was 0.60. Then, an estimated marginal contribution of “fatigue = present” for this subset would be 0.75 – 0.60 = 0.15. By taking a weighted average of the marginal contributions for each subset, an estimate of 𝜙 for “fatigue = present” is obtained (Figure A2). Repeating the calculation shown in Figure A2 for each feature will yield the set of 𝜙s that comprise an explanation for the person of interest. A full explanation might read as follows: relative to the average risk prediction of 0.10, a temperature of 102.3F increased this person’s risk by 0.35, presence of a cough increased this person’s risk by 0.20, absence of a runny nose decreased this person’s risk by 0.05, and presence of fatigue increased this person’s risk by 0.15. By summing all 𝜙 values with the average prediction, the person’s prediction of 0.75 (i.e., 0.10 + 0.35 + 0.20 + -0.05 + 0.15 = 0.75) is obtained. Thus, the 𝜙 value of a feature provides an estimate of how much the feature changes the model prediction relative to the average prediction. 129 Figure A2. Calculation of the Shapley value, ϕ, for the presence of fatigue. All possible subset combinations are enumerated and weighted by the proportion of all possible feature permutations they represent. For each subset, the model prediction is estimated with and without the feature of interest, which are 𝑓𝑥(𝑆 ∪ {𝑓𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑒 = 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡}) and 𝑓𝑥(𝑆), respectively. These estimates are obtained by filling in any missing feature values with randomly sampled values from a training dataset and obtaining the model prediction, then averaging the predictions from repeated runs of this procedure. Subtracting estimates of 𝑓𝑥(𝑆 ∪ {𝑓𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑒 = 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡}) and 𝑓𝑥(𝑆) for a subset gives us an estimate of the marginal contribution of the presence of fatigue for that subset. The final Shapley value is obtained by taking a weighted sum of the marginal contribution estimates of each subset. As can be clearly seen in the above example, the computation of the Shapley values for a set of features is non-trivial. The SHAP algorithm offers both model-agnostic and model-specific methods for efficiently approximating the Shapley values defined by Equation 4 to obtain explanations for any input data type. Although the authors point to previously defined model-agnostic methods for estimating Shapley values, they also include a new, more computationally efficient method called Kernel SHAP. The authors also provide computationally efficient, model-specific methods for estimating the Shapley values of linear models, deep learning models, and tree-based models. An overview of the Kernel SHAP explainer is provided below. Specific details 130 on the theory and implementation of the model-specific explainers can be found in the SHAP paper and code.124,126 The following description for the Kernel SHAP explainer is based on the SHAP papers124,125 as well as the code and documentation for SHAP version 0.24.0.126 Kernel SHAP proposes Shapley values as the solution to the linear model formulation of the LIME algorithm (see previous section), thus allowing for Shapley values to be approximated using a weighted linear regression. This permits a joint estimation of all Shapley values, which reduces the samples needed to provide accurate estimates of the Shapley values. To estimate the average model prediction and simulate missing features as in the example, Kernel SHAP requires a user-provided background dataset. This can be the entire training dataset used to learn the original predictive model; however, for larger datasets the algorithm becomes very computationally expensive. Therefore, it is recommended that for larger training datasets, users provide a dataset of reference values that adequately summarize the training data, such as point estimates for each feature (e.g., median or mean) or weighted samples produced by k-means or k-medians clustering. Kernel SHAP computes the average model prediction as the expected value of the model prediction on the background dataset. To efficiently estimate Shapley values, Kernel SHAP first begins by determining which feature values in the instance to be explained vary (i.e., have a different value) from the values in the provided background dataset. If a feature does not vary compared to the background dataset, it is assumed to have no effect on the model prediction and is assigned a Shapley value of 0. This helps reduce the number of computations required by the algorithm. To estimate the Shapley values of the remaining features, Kernel SHAP first generates a weighted dataset of samples from all possible feature subsets, where features in the subset are equal to the value of the instance to be explained and features not in the subset are equal to the 131 background dataset values. Depending on whether the background dataset contains a single reference value or a set of reference values, a “sample” in the weighted dataset may consist of a single row or a set of rows, respectively. To further reduce computation time, users can specify the number of samples (i.e., model evaluations) that Kernel SHAP is permitted to use, with higher sample sizes leading to more stable estimates. By default, Kernel SHAP uses 2(# of varying features) + 211 samples and caps the maximum number of samples allowed at 230. If given enough samples, Kernel SHAP will fully enumerate all possible subset sizes; otherwise, the algorithm first enumerates as many high-weighted subset sizes as possible (e.g., |𝑆| = 0 and |𝑆| = 1 in Figure A2), then uses any leftover samples to randomly sample subsets from the remaining subset sizes. If more samples are allowed than are needed to fully enumerate each subset, unused samples are discarded to improve computational efficiency. For each of the samples in the weighted dataset, the algorithm estimates the change in the model prediction from the average model prediction. For a background dataset using a set of reference values, this estimate is the expected value of the model prediction over all rows in the sample minus the average model prediction. By default, if less than 20% of all possible subsets have been enumerated in the weighted dataset, Kernel SHAP performs feature selection using a Lasso model with least angle regression using the Akaike information criterion for model selection. The user has optional control over whether to run feature selection as well as the L1 regularization parameter used in the Lasso model. Finally, Kernel SHAP uses the weighted dataset of samples and their respective estimated changes in the model prediction to solve a least squares regression to obtain the Shapley values for the remaining features. 132 As with the LIME algorithm, the implementation of the SHAP algorithm allows users control over parameters that could impact the explanations generated. Thus, parameters require careful selection by the user. Appendix A.3 Algorithm Comparison Experiments To select between the SHAP and LIME algorithms, I performed experiments comparing the algorithms on two properties of explainers previously identified as desirable in the literature: 1) fidelity (i.e., the explanation model should accurately reflect the underlying predictive model’s behavior) and 2) computational efficiency.12,20,21,65 I believe that these two properties will be essential for any explanation approach used in healthcare. For an model-agnostic, instance-level explanation approach based on feature influence, I proposed the following metrics for quantitatively measuring these properties: Fidelity: There should exist some function of the set of generated feature influence values, 𝑔(𝜙), that approximates the original model prediction, 𝑓(𝑥). A high-fidelity explanation approach is one that generates explanations such that 𝑔(𝜙) ≅ 𝑓(𝑥). Computational Efficiency: The time required to generate a single explanation. Several preliminary experiments comparing the LIME and SHAP algorithms on their fidelity and computational efficiency were conducted. To conduct experiments, two datasets curated in previous research projects were used: 1) a dataset to predict 30-day all-cause pediatric hospital readmission risk and 2) a dataset to predict 1-year postpartum infant mortality risk. To enable compatibility with the explanation algorithms, comparable Python versions of the models previously learned on each of these datasets were generated. A short Python module was developed 133 to facilitate the use of both explanation algorithms and conduct experiments. Datasets and models are described in subsection A.3.1, the experiments are described in A.3.2, the results are presented in subsection A.3.3, and subsection A.3.4 presents a discussion of all results and uses them to justify the selection of an explanation algorithm to be used in the work. Appendix A.3.1 Datasets and Models 30-day all-cause pediatric hospital readmission risk: This dataset constituted all clinical and administrative data for all inpatient visits to CHP from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2013. Patients that died during admission, were over 21 years of age, or did not have a recorded age were excluded from the dataset. A readmission was defined as any inpatient visit followed by a second inpatient admission within 30 days of discharge from the initial visit. Multiple readmissions within 30 days for a single patient were treated as separate cases. The final dataset was comprised of 91,045 visits (13,548 readmission cases; 77,497 non-readmission controls). For brevity, I have left out the specific details of the data cleaning, standardization, and feature engineering processes. It is important to note that all numeric features were discretized using the minimum-description-length criterion discretization method101 and missing data were treated as separate categories. In the original model learning process, features were selected using a two-stage predictor-selection process which included an IG filtration step followed by a wrapper-based search. A series of different Naïve Bayes models using various combinations of medical data sources (e.g., medications+labs, demographics only, etc.) were trained using WEKA.103 The best performing model was trained using all data sources, included 32 features, and achieved an AUROC of 0.806 on an independent test dataset. To generate a comparable Python version of this model, a 70/30 stratified split of the 91,045 visits in the dataset was used to generate training and 134 testing data. Using the 32 features from the best performing model and one-hot encoding procedures, a Naïve Bayes classifier was learned on the training data. The learned model achieved performance comparable to the original best performing model, with an AUROC of 0.806 for the test dataset. 1-year postpartum infant mortality risk: This dataset was obtained from the Magee Obstetric Medical and Infant (MOMI) Database and comprised demographic and medical information for all deliveries at Magee-Women’s Hospital from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2014. Infant death cases were identified by linking the MOMI dataset with data from the Department of Health Services (DHS). Stillbirths and fetal deaths were excluded. The final dataset encompassed 75,842 records (494 infant death cases; 75,348 alive controls). Again, for brevity, I have left out the specific details of the data cleaning, standardization, and feature engineering processes. It should be noted that missing values were imputed by simple random sampling from known data and continuous variables were discretized using the entropy minimization heuristic method. The final dataset contained 102 features for analysis. A variety of models were learned using R, but the highest performing model was a ridge logistic regression trained on 29 features selected using a sequential IG filter, which achieved an average AUROC of 0.933 with 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset (i.e., all 75,842 visits). To generate a comparable Python version of this model, all 75,842 visits in the dataset and one-hot encoding procedures were used to learn a ridge logistic regression using the 29 features from the best performing model. The learned model exhibited comparable performance to the original best performing model, achieving an average AUROC of 0.925 with 10-fold cross-validation on the entire dataset. 135 Appendix A.3.2 Experiments 500 patients (250 cases, 250 controls) were randomly sampled from each dataset to use in experiments. As noted in sections A.1 and A.3, the parameter settings can affect the explanations produced by both the LIME and SHAP algorithms; therefore, for each patient, LIME and SHAP explanations were generated under varying parameter settings. For the LIME algorithm, varied parameter settings included: 1) the number of perturbed samples used to learn the linear regression model and 2) the number of features selected for the explanation (i.e., the two parameter settings most likely to influence the explanations generated). For the SHAP algorithm, a background dataset consisting of the median value for each feature was used and varied parameter settings included the number of samples used to estimate the Shapley values of the features. Default values for all other user-controllable parameters were used. Explanations were generated for the prediction of the target class of interest (i.e., ""Readmitted"" for readmission model and ""Death"" for infant mortality model). The two properties identified in the introduction were as assessed as follows: Fidelity: Following the measure defined in the introduction, fidelity error was estimated for each explanation as 𝑔(𝜙) − 𝑓(𝑥), where 𝑔(𝜙) is a function of the set of generated feature influence values that approximates the original model prediction, 𝑓(𝑥). For the LIME algorithm, 𝑔(𝜙) takes the form of a local linear regression. For the SHAP algorithm, 𝑔(𝜙) is simply the sum of all the Shapley values learned for each feature and a base value (i.e., the average model prediction or the expected model prediction when no features are known). Theoretically, the SHAP algorithm guarantees fidelity (i.e., guarantees that 𝑔(𝜙) = 𝑓(𝑥)), but as approximation methods are used to estimate the Shapely values it is beneficial to check that this guarantee holds true for 136 the implementation of the algorithm. For each dataset, the median absolute error (MAE) in fidelity was calculated across all 500 patients for each algorithm and varied parameter setting. Computational Efficiency: To estimate computational efficiency of the algorithms, the time to generate each explanation was measured. Mean and total computation times for each algorithm were calculated across the 500 patients from each dataset under varying numbers of samples used to generate the explanation. For the LIME algorithm, the number of explanation features had minimal impact on computation time for a single explanation and so all timing experiments were performed using 6 features in the explanation. This value was based on the findings from the fidelity experiments (i.e., LIME’s fidelity error on the two datasets appears to be optimal somewhere between 5 and 10 features). Appendix A.3.3 Results Figure A3 shows the MAE in fidelity on each dataset for the LIME algorithm under varying parameter settings. The MAE in fidelity for the SHAP algorithm was always 0 for both datasets. Figure A3. LIME median absolute error (MAE) in fidelity. The MAE in fidelity for the LIME algorithm under varying parameter settings is shown for the readmission dataset (left plot) and the infant mortality dataset (right plot). 137 The mean and total computation times for the LIME and SHAP algorithms under varying parameter settings are shown in Table A1 and Table A2, respectively. Table A1. Mean time to compute a single explanation for LIME and SHAP algorithms Number of samples used to generate explanation 500 1000 3000 5000 7000 Readmission Dataset SHAP mean time (s) 0.04 0.05 0.09 0.11 0.14 LIME mean time (s) 0.39 0.54 1.26 1.90 2.52 Infant Mortality Dataset SHAP mean time (s) 0.05 0.05 0.04 0.01 0.01 LIME mean time (s) 1.09 1.53 3.90 1.83 2.38 Table A2.

On the other hand, Figure A3 demonstrates that the LIME algorithm error in fidelity varies across parameters and datasets. This indicates that use of the LIME algorithm to generate explanations would require careful selection of algorithm parameters for each dataset to reduce errors in fidelity. Additionally, as no parameter setting is likely to be ideal for all instances in a dataset, it would be necessary to show users an estimate of the error in the explanation generation process. Thus, the SHAP algorithm seems to be a better choice to ensure explanation fidelity. Table A1 and Table A2 show that the SHAP algorithm appears to be faster than the LIME algorithm and its computation time is less affected by the number of samples used to generate the 138 explanation. It should be noted that the SHAP algorithm computation time is highly dependent on the background dataset provided to the algorithm. Although not explored in these preliminary experiments, larger background datasets may lead to significant decreases in the algorithm’s computational efficiency. However, unlike the LIME algorithm where each explanation must be computed individually, the SHAP algorithm also includes functions to efficiently compute explanations in large batches. These functions were not explored in the preliminary experiments but are worth noting for future studies. Based on these preliminary timing experiments, the SHAP algorithm appears to offer better computational efficiency than the LIME algorithm. As the SHAP algorithm guarantees explanation fidelity and requires less computation time than the LIME algorithm, the SHAP algorithm was selected for use in the proposed work. It is important to note that only preliminary experiments were conducted; however, the conducted experiments provided sufficient evidence to support my selection of the SHAP algorithm. More rigorous experiments comparing the LIME and SHAP algorithms are left for future work. 139 Appendix B Qualitative Inquiry Questionnaires and Question Guide 140 Focus Group Question Guide Model Discussion Question Guide  How would you feel about deploying these kind of predictive models into clinical practice?  What practical applications do you think these kinds of models could have in clinical practice?  Would you feel confident in the predictions provided by these kinds of models?  What additional information about the model would you require in order to have confidence in its predictions?  Do you think you would use predictions from models like this?

Context of use--when & where The environment in which the explanation will be used, which is often related to the stage of system development. Environment will dictate the available user time and cognitive capacity, the available technical resources, and the user’s perception of the system, which all may influence explanation design. This main category code is meant for organizational purposes only and should not be applied. 1.1 Environment Aspects of the environment that will affect how an explanation needs to be designed in order to support use within that environment. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category, but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 1.1.1 Cognitive and time resources Participant cognitive capacity and/or time availability to use the system in a specific environment. This includes comments about cognitive effort to process information in a given time frame (e.g., ease and speed of information processing, time restrictions, willingness to spend mental effort or time) and workflow or other environmental influences that imply a possible impact on cognitive capacity or time availability (e.g., task order, when/how/where to capture attention) Example: -Speed or ease with which knowledge can be obtained from system (e.g., faster synthesis of relevant information, familiarity with the way information is presented) 1.1.2 Social and organizational influences Any aspect of the social or organizational environment in which the system is being used that may impact system development, design, or application. This can include things related to participant workflow, organizational infrastructure (e.g., staffing procedures/challenges, patient triage/bed assignment procedures/challenges, education/training programs, financial policies), and social pressure/expectations. Examples: -Workflow, such as rounding practices, patient/colleague interactions, EHR interactions, etc. -Staffing/triaging procedures, such as bed availability, staff availability, etc. 1.1.3 Technical resources Technical resources available (e.g., compatibility with existing systems, processing/memory constraints) when using the system in a specific environment. This can include limitations of pre-existing systems, difficulties with real-time data processing, and challenges in implementation and/or maintenance of the system. 1.2 System stage Design/information needs in a specific system stage (e.g., development, implementation, deployment). This code should only be applied when a different system stage may require a change in information/design needs. Example: -a participant mentions specific information which would assist in validating the predictive model (this may be an indirect reference to information/design needs in the development stage, which may differ from needs in the deployment stage) 143 2. Context of use--who User's cognition (e.g., knowledge, experience, capabilities, etc.) and the user’s relationship to the system at the time the explanation is being provided. A user may have several different relationships with the system over time, and thus their explanation needs may change with varying roles. This main category code is meant for organizational purposes only and should not be applied. 2.1 Cognition & experiences The knowledge, experience, capabilities, etc. of the user of a system. Three main categories of user cognition to consider include AI experts, domain experts, and lay persons. Of particular interest is any aspect of the user’s background knowledge or prior experiences that may bias their opinion of or attitude toward a new system. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 2.1.1 Background knowledge Participant’s prior level of knowledge of ML/AI/predictive modelling concepts. Includes remarks/questions that suggest knowledge (or lack thereof) of predictive models (e.g., objective reference to known model, mentions of ML algorithms, model limitations/validity) or the model development process (e.g., cohort definition, data cleaning, feature engineering, training, evaluation, bias/overfitting, best practices). Not applicable to remarks/questions on presentation content (e.g., AUC, inputs) 2.1.2 Prior experiences Participant’s prior experience with using an ML/AI tool or another information system (e.g., EHR). This code is restricted for use when the participant expresses either a positive or negative opinion or attitude about the design, credibility, usability, or utility of the tool/system, and should not be used to code objective comparisons of tools/systems (e.g., comparing performance or data inputs, objective discussions on design and implementation). 2.2 Relationship to system The user's relationship to the system at the time the explanation is being provided. Main roles to consider can be engineer, developer, owner, end-user, data subject, and stakeholder. It should be noted that a user may occupy more than one role simultaneously. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 2.2.1 User perspective How system design or system application might differ based on the user's current relationship with the system. This can include comments about design differences based on intended system application (e.g., developer vs end-user needs, different end-user information needs). This code should not be applied to design/application differences that would arise from variation in user cognition & experiences (e.g., background knowledge, thought processes) 3. Context of use--why User needs and goals that drive the need for an explanation. Four general reasons why explanations of intelligent systems are required include verification, improvement, learning, and compliance. Needs/goals will vary according to the who/when/where elements of the context of use. This main category code is meant for organizational purposes only and should not be applied. 3.1 Compliance Closely related to verification (3.4), this refers to any activities aimed at ensuring the system adheres to an established legal, moral, or other societal standard. This includes all comments on the system from an ethical, moral or legal/organizational policy standpoint. 144 3.2 Improvement Closely tied with verification (3.4), this covers activities related to improving system performance and efficiency. May include incorporating domain knowledge to reduce biases in or improve generalization of model, comparing/selecting models, and improving system response times. Includes suggested changes in data collection, data inclusion/exclusion, data processing, and target outcomes/definitions. Not applicable to comments about or suggestions to improve model utility (e.g. possible applications of current model information, post-hoc analyses such as distribution of risk scores across units, or tracking risk scores and outcomes of specific patients). Examples: -suggestions to explore predictions of an outcome other than 24-hr pediatric ICU mortality (e.g., time to event predictions, morbidity, ICU transfer, mortality in a specific patient population, etc.) -suggestions to include additional data such as tests, staffing, comorbidities, bed location, etc. -suggestions to improve data processing such as removing outliers, dropping bad values, defining normal ranges, adjusting for age/condition, etc. 3.3 Learning Remarks/questions indicating participant is seeking to gain knowledge or information from the system, including identifying new data patterns, generating/testing new hypotheses, and/or providing support for decision-making (e.g., provide supporting evidence for a decision, improve decision-making speed or accuracy, identifying actionable information such as courses of action or modifiable risk factors). 3.4 Verification A possible reason for requiring an explanation of an intelligent system. Includes examining how decisions/suggestions are made by the system to ensure it is operating as expected, which may include activities such as detecting biases, finding/debugging errors, and ensuring that system reasoning aligns with domain knowledge. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 3.4.1 Comparing against known model Comparison of model to existing model/tool to validate some aspect of the system (e.g., credibility). Only applicable to remarks that compare objective metrics (e.g., performance, data collection & processing). Not applicable to participant opinions of existing models or preferences for system content & design (use ""prior experiences"" and ""explanation design"" category codes instead). Generally not applicable to comments related to system utility (use ""Learning"" category codes instead). 3.4.2 Comparing model information to domain knowledge Comparison of system information against clinical knowledge to verify some aspect of the model (e.g., credibility). This can include comments or questions about possible data biases, information validity, etc. Not applicable to remarks where participants are suggesting improvements based on clinical knowledge. Generally not applicable to comments related to system utility (use ""Learning"" category codes instead). 3.4.3 Seeking information on model development processes Remarks/questions seeking to validate any aspect of the model development and maintenance process (e.g., cohort definition, data sources, data collection/inclusion/exclusion, cleaning processes, feature engineering/selection, model learning process, evaluation, maintenance over time). Applicable only when participants make assumptions about or attempt to clarify/understand/question the model development/maintenance process and is not applicable to suggestions for improvement. 145 4. Explanation design--how Can generally be determined by the who and why questions of context of use, and refers to the way in which the content of an explanation is presented to a user. The presentation of an explanation can generally be summarized using 3 main categories: dimensionality, explanation unit granularity and organization, and information representation. This main category code is meant for organizational purposes only and should not be applied. 4.1 Dimensionality A main category to consider when designing an explanation. Refers to the processing size/levels of explanation information, which may include the overall size of an explanation or interactive exploration options. Should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 4.1.2 Size & interactivity preferences Preferences for the size and/or interactivity options in the explanation design. Applicable to preferences on interactivity/size options in mock-ups (e.g., plot hover and drop-down select capabilities, link between explanation plot and predictor table, scrollable list of predictors) and any suggestions for interactivity/size options not shown in mock-ups (e.g., interactions between visualizations, amount of information content, interactive explanation exploration options). 4.2 Explanation unit & organization Preferences regarding the granularity and organization of the explanation units. This includes preferences on the unit of explanation or predictor granularity (e.g., raw predictors, grouped/summarized predictors, increasing/decreasing or net contributions) and organization of the explanation units (e.g., order of display, location of increase/decrease contributions, grouping into different plots). Applicable to both remarks on mock-up options and suggested alternatives. 4.3 Information representation A main category to consider when designing an explanation. This includes the vocabulary, data structures, and visualizations used to express information. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 4.3.1 Data visualization preferences Specific preferences for how data is displayed in the explanation design, which includes data structures (e.g., free-text, data tables, lists) and graphical representations (e.g., images, plots/charts, diagrams) used to display information. This includes participant preferences for mock-up options (e.g., tornado vs. force plot) and alternative suggestions. Applicable to participant suggestions for new or alternative displays. Generally not applicable to information content preferences or vocabulary/phrasing preferences, use ""explanation design--what"" and “vocabulary preferences” codes instead. 4.3.2 Vocabulary preferences Specific preferences for the vocabulary used in the explanation design. Includes how test content is worded (e.g., phrasing used to describe predictors and contributions), expression of numerical information (e.g., risk in probability vs. odds, displaying probability as decimal or percentage), and domain-specific terms/abbreviations that should be used. Often applicable when participants express confusion/difficulties when trying to interpret text/numerical information. 5. Explanation design--what Generally determined by the answers to the who and why of the context of use, and refers to the content that needs to be included in an explanation. Content of an explanation typically refers to the type of explanation being provided and any information supporting the interpretation of that explanation. This main category code is meant for organizational purposes only and should not be applied. 146 5.1 Supporting information Any information that is not a part of the explanation but is required to help support the user's interpretation/understanding of the explanation. This may include things such as source data used in the model or explanation algorithm, supplemental data, and training materials. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 5.1.1 Interpretation information Needs for training information on how to interpret explanation information. This includes remarks/questions that indicate participant confusion and/or lack of understanding based on the system design (e.g., trouble interpreting predictors). Not applicable to momentary confusion (i.e., if participant voices question but quickly figures it out themselves). Not applicable to suggestions for data to include in interface to support explanation interpretation (use other “source & supplemental data” code instead). Not applicable to preferences/opinions on system design. Examples: -confusion on how to interpret predictor descriptions (e.g., making sense of discretized ranges or feature descriptions) -confusion on how to interpret predictor contributions and their relation to the baseline and model predictions Examples where “interpretation information” and “source & supplemental data” (5.1.2) both apply: -If it was more clear how to interpret xxx information, the xxx information would help me better understand the prediction and/or explanation -XXX information seems like it might be useful in understanding the prediction and/or explanation, but I find it confusing to interpret -If the system could include xxx information expressed in yyy manner, it would really help me interpret/understand the prediction/explanation 5.1.2 Source & supplemental data Preferences/suggestions for including information about the prediction model (e.g., performance statistics, certainty measures, development processes), source data used by the model or explanation algorithm (e.g., raw data used to derive predictors, (un)discretised predictor values, contribution values), or any other supplemental data required to support interpretation of the prediction or explanation (e.g., interventions, care context). Not applicable to suggestions for improvements to the model. Examples: -direct/indirect comments on utility of information in explanation plot, predictor table, raw data plots, etc. (e.g., participant uses raw data plot or predictor table to investigate a predictor in explanation plot) -requests for information on model (e.g., confidence intervals, performance information, feature engineering/selection, etc.) -requests for information not used by model such as care interventions performed, staffing/triaging/bed assignment procedures that may have affected care, additional patient data needed to interpret prediction, etc. -comments on utility of diagnosis, demographic & utilization tables Examples where “interpretation information” (5.1.1) and “source & supplemental data” both apply: -If it was more clear how to interpret xxx information, the xxx information would help me better understand the prediction and/or explanation -XXX information seems like it might be useful in understanding the prediction and/or explanation, but I find it confusing to interpret -If the system could include xxx information expressed in yyy manner, it would really help me interpret/understand the prediction/explanation 147 5.2 Type of explanation One part of explanation content refers to the type of explanation that is required, such as whether the explanation is one of processes or behavior and whether it is targeted at the local or global level. Type of explanation can generally be determined by the type of questions the user is asking or the reasoning processes the user is trying to use. This parent code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 5.2.1. Intelligibility query Specific intelligibility queries (i.e., “inputs”, “outputs”, “certainty”, “why not”/”how to”, “why”, “what if”, “when”) about the system. Includes comments indicating desire to know what data/predictors/inputs are used, what predictions/outputs can be produced, how (un)certain the model is in its predictions, why inputs produce certain outputs or how to get specific outputs, how changing inputs influences outputs, etc. Coding for intelligibility queries in the form of a question should generally not include answers to the question. Often applicable when ""seeking information on model development process"" code is used. Generally, not applicable to remarks regarding specific design elements. Examples: -questions on data/inputs being used by the model -comments/questions on predictions, including certainty of predictions, how/why predictions are produced, how changes in inputs might influence predictions. 5.2.2 Level & target preferences Preferences for explanation level (local/global) and target (behavior/processes). Includes comments/questions directly/indirectly expressing an interest in knowing model internals (e.g., weights, mathematical relationships, handling correlated predictors), general trends learned (e.g., how/why the model makes predictions for patient population; general risk factors), and how/why the model makes predictions for individual patients (e.g., patient-specific risk factors). 6. Perceptions of the system Perceptions of the overall system application. This includes perceptions on the barriers and facilitators to system adoption. For risk prediction models, adoption is closely tied to the utility, credibility, and usability of a model or system. This parent category code should only be applied when a participant comment falls within this parent category but none of its children codes can be applied appropriately. 6.1 Perceptions of system credibility The credibility, or ""believability"", of the system. Includes comments on any aspect of the system that may influence the participant’s confidence in prediction accuracy (e.g., high performance may increase confidence, predictors that are outliers/bad data points may decrease it). Not applicable to remarks about the credibility of existing systems, use ""prior experiences"" code instead. Often applicable with ""verification"" category codes. Examples: -willingness to use/trial system based on performance (e.g., AUC) -scepticism about model predictions based on identified data errors/biases, missing info, etc. -comparing model performance/content with domain knowledge or to known model 6.2 Perceptions of system usability The usability, or ease of use and learnability, of the system (i.e., can the intended goal be accomplished using the system or will users have difficulty?). Includes comments about aspects of the system that facilitate or impede use (e.g., design elements that make information processing easier/harder) and preferences between mock-ups (e.g., saying one mock-up was easier to use/understand than another). Not applicable to remarks about 148 the usability of existing systems, use ""prior experiences"" code instead. Often applied with “explanation design” codes. Examples: -about mock-ups that are easier/harder to use than others -design elements that exacerbate/alleviate confusion, cognitive effort, time requirements -design elements that facilitate information synthesis or interpretation 6.3 Perceptions of system utility The utility, or usefulness, of the system (i.e., is the intended use of the system useful to pursue? will users use it?). Includes suggestions for possible users of the system and comments on the value of system information (e.g., information provided is perceived as informative). Not applicable to remarks about the utility of existing systems, use ""prior experiences"" code instead. Often applicable with ""learning"" & ""improvement"" codes. Examples: -suggesting possible applications of the current model/system -(dis)interest in continued development of system -(dis)interest in information provided by system (e.g., “it’s not telling me anything new”, “this information could support xxx decision or help me determine xxx faster”) 149 Appendix D Evaluation Study Introductory Slides 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 Appendix E Evaluation Study Questionnaires Background Questionnaire Patient Case Questionnaire 158 UTAUT Questionnaires 159 Bibliography 1.

In a 2020 meta analysis by Yuan et al., breast cancer-screening via combined mammography and ultrasound had a clinical sensitivty (recall) of 0.96.10 A comparable precision metric was not available. None of the models were able to achieve comparable recall with this reported method. With that in mind, it is also important to consider limitations. The clinical application of this model is limited on several fronts. First, the dataset employs biopsied tissue which has had numerous features that are not commonly evaluated in standard Pathology reports. Second, the generalizability and performance of this model is also unclear since an independent secondary dataset was not available to assess each model’s true generalizability. Future work in this area will continue to explore the core research question. Feature-based parameterization of images using classifier methods may not be able to enhance our current clinical screening or diagnosis of breast cancer. However, newer approaches using deep learning neural networks are showing exciting potential on the image itself rather than man-made extracted feature sets as shown in this study.3 DiscussionMethodsThe UCI Machine Learning Repository Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set was used for this project which is a publicly available online dataset with no patient identifiers made available through the ScikitLearn library.9 Scikit-learn 0.23 was used along with the Jupyter Notebook IDE to conduct this study.• Gaussian Naive Bayes (gnb)• K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)• Logistic Regression (log)• Decision Tree (dt)• Random Forest Ensemble (rf)• Support Vector Classifier (svm)• Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (nn)The model development process is summarized in FIGURE 2. The data set contained 30 features with a binary target variable (benign or malignant). 20% of the data was removed prior to training for use in final validation. In order to optimize the performance of the training algorithms and minimize initial bias, the training set prevalence was stratified to equalize the target classes (malignancy prevalence = 63% prior to equalization). The prevalence was equalized using both downsampling of the majority class (malignancy) and upsampling of the minority class (benign).To identify and optimize the model, a grid search with 10-fold cross validation was employed for the below scikit-learn algorithms. The abbreviations used in figures/tables are provided in parentheses. Learning Goals and Research QuestionThe components of this training were focused on the below four goals:• Learn the foundational statistical concepts for evaluating ML models• Learn the common approaches to supervised ML• Learn the approaches to cross validation and understand how to define training and test data sets in the model building process (in tune with CRISP-DM)• Learn how to optimize models using hyperparameter tuning The exercises and applications were framed in the following research question: How do suprvised binary classifer ML models perform relative to previously published breast cancer screening methods?

The impact of HAIs is reflected in consid-rable clinical and financial burden in terms of prolonged hospitaltay, excess death and long-term disability, increased antimicrobialesistance, increased direct costs for health systems and financialoss for patients and families [2]. It is estimated that more than 2.6illion new cases of healthcare-associated infections occur everyear in Europe, with a cumulative burden higher than all othereported infectious diseases [3,4]. The alarming burden of HAIs hasecently been highlighted in South East Asia and Africa [5,6]. Inhe US, 1 in 31 patients per day develop at least one healthcare-ssociated infection, overall responsible for 72,000 deaths per year46]. Meta-analyses estimated in almost $10 billion the annual costn the US for the cumulative burden of: central line-associatedloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumoniaVAP), surgical site infections (SSI), Clostridium difficile infectionsCDI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) [8].Surveillance of HAIs is the foundation for organizing, imple-enting, and maintaining effective infection prevention andontrol programs. Objectives of HAIs surveillance are: to quantifyates of infections and compare them within/between healthcareacilities, engage clinical teams to adopt best practices, introducevidence-based and cost-effective interventions to reduce HAI ando identify priority areas where to allocate resources. Surveil-ance data is used to quantify and monitor HAIs burden, to detectutbreaks, to identify risk factors, to plan, implement and evalu-te control interventions, to identify areas for improvement, ando meet reporting mandates [13]. Various surveillance methodsave been recommended and validated [9], including continuousurveillance, active/passive surveillance, prevalence surveys, alert-ased surveillance, all of which, with different characteristics andt different rates are labor intensive, costly and time consuming10].The advances in Information Technologies (IT) and the progres-ive digitalization of health data offer new tools and potential forhe healthcare sector, including for the automation of HAIs surveil-ance [11]. As recently outlined, the availability of different sources’lectronic health data might boost electronic HAI surveillance sys-ems on at least three different levels: (i) enhancing the reliability,fficiency and standardization of surveillance practices [11], (ii)educing costs and saving times, and (iii) allowing real-time anal-sis and action [12].Although automated and semiautomated HAI surveillance sys-ems are traditionally based on fix and a priori defined classificationlgorithms or simple rule-based decision trees, new evidence sug-Please cite this article in press as: Scardoni A, et al.

Inbroad terms, Machine Learning (ML) refer to the iterative and auto-matic optimization of mathematical models that fits the availabledata with progressive accuracy. Building on the theoretical con-cepts outlined in Box 1, its application to infection prevention andcontrol can lead to an improved understanding of HAIs risk factors,improved patient risk stratification, identification of transmissionpathways, as well as timely or real-time detection and control.Despites such promising approach, scant evidence is available onthe literature on ML implementation in the field of HAIs and noclear patterns emerges on its impact.Aim of the current study is to collect and summarize the avail-able evidence on the application and impact of Artificial Intelligenceto HAIs control. Specific objectives are: to systematically retrieve (i)experiences of AI-based HAIs detection, (ii) their performance mea-sures, as compared to traditional manual or automated detectionmethods, (iii) to pool and critically appraise the available evidenceon the topic, outlining potential strengths and pitfalls and high-lighting current gaps in knowledge.MethodsAs done before [23], the review’s methods were defined inadvance following the Prepared Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [24].Criteria for considering studiesWe included publications that reported on the use of machinelearning-based tools to detect and control HAIs. All healthcare-associated infections were considered and no restrictions wereapplied by type of healthcare facility. Only studies reporting orig-inal data were included. Eligible study designs included clinicaltrials, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort and case-controlstudies. Literature reviews were screened to retrieve relevant pri-mary data. Inclusion was restricted to full text papers; conferenceabstracts, posters and study protocols were excluded. Outcomes ofinterest included all possible performance measures, as well as allpossible clinical, organizational and economic outcomes.Search methods for identification of studiesStudies were identified by searching the electronic databasesMedline and Embase. The search strategy was first developed inMedline using a combination of free text and Mesh terms, and thenadapted for use in the other databases. Complete search strategiesence-based tools to control healthcare associated infections: A://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.006are available in Appendix A. Further studies were retrieved frommanual reference listing of relevant articles and consultation withexperts in the field. Studies published in English through June 2018were included.ARTICLE ING ModelJIPH-1375; No. of Pages 17A. Scardoni et al. / Journal of Infection andBox 1: Artificial intelligence and machine learning mod-elsArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a term of great rethorical (andevocative) power [13], but a very low descriptive one, despiteits wide use. In this paper we will refer to the so called “nar-row AI”, which regards computational systems developed toexecute specific and circumscribed tasks as much as (or evenmore) effectively than human performers [21], and definitelymore efficiently than humans. Many recent AI systems are builtby means of Machine Learning (ML). This latter is an umbrellaterm for a wide and heterogeneous set of statistical and com-putational techniques that are usually applied to build (narrow)“AI systems” that exhibit very good performance in tasksinvolving pattern matching and signal recognition, includingimage recognition. Despite their great diversity, the elementthat is common to all ML methods is the iterative and automaticoptimization of a mathematical model that fits (i.e., explains,reproduces, interpolates) the available data, the so called train-ing dataset: for this reason, ML is an approach that is based onthe available data rather than on explicit and formal represen-tations of either declarative and procedural knowledge (rulesand algorithms). The tasks where ML models achieve high per-formance can be divided in either discriminative tasks, thatis regarding the classification of a new instance of data on thebasis of similar data in the training set; or regressive tasks,when the model is aimed at estimating an unknown numeri-cal value of a data instance. In medical terms, discriminativemodels can be mainly used to support diagnostic reasoning;regression models can be useful for prognostic and thera-peutic purposes. Discriminative model can be further dividedaccording to whether they work on data that have been previ-ously labeled by domain experts or not: in the former case, themodels are said to be supervised; in the latter case they areunsupervised (like in case of clustering algorithms).Despite the existence of many models, a small number ofthem usually result to outperform the others: to identify thesemodels, a recent survey has tested an impressive number ofdifferent classifiers (n = 179) on a likewise impressive num-ber of different data sets (n = 121) and concluded that randomforests and support vector machines (with Gaussian kernel)are usually the best performing models [16]. Although accu-racy (and hence the complementary concept, error rate) isan important feature of ML models, these models are usu-ally developed by finding an acceptable compromise betweenaccuracy and complexity, as depicted in Fig. 1, that is betweenthe problem of underfitting, which occurs when the model istoo simplistic to get the intrinsic complexity of both the trainingdata and any possible new data and is characterized by high“bias”; and overfitting, that is the opposite condition when themodel “mirrors” the training data too closely but generalizespoorly on new (unseen) data, that is when bias is relativelylow but variance too high to yield value in real-world settings[17–20]. Recently, the medical community has also emphasizedthe importance to consider other dimensions besides accuracyand complexity in the development of ML models, like explain-ability and causability: the former is the capacity of the AIsystem to provide credible explanations of the advice given soas to “open” the black-box of models that would be inscrutableotherwise; the latter regards the quality of these explanationsto allow “human expert achieve a specified level of causalunderstanding with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfactionDbirThe 27 included studies corresponded to 26 different studyin a specified context of use” [22].ata collection and analysisIdentified studies were independently reviewed for eligibilityPlease cite this article in press as: Scardoni A, et al.

J Infect Public Health (2020), httpsy two authors (AS, FB) in a two-step based process; a first screen-ng was performed based on title and abstract while full texts wereetrieved for the second screening. At both stages disagreements by PRESS Public Health xxx (2020) xxx–xxx 3reviewers were resolved by consensus and consultation with seniorauthors (AO, FC). Data were extracted by two authors (AS, FB) super-vised by a third and fourth author (AO, FC) using a standardizeddata extraction spreadsheet. The data extraction spreadsheet waspiloted on 10 randomly selected papers and modified accordingly.Data extraction included: authors’ affiliation, journal, publicationyear, country of studies’ implementation, study design, study set-ting, study period, type of infection, sample size, machine learningmodel (intervention), comparison model, information on analysisperformed, outcomes of interest, prediction metrics and results.Analysis and quality appraisalWe performed descriptive analysis to report the characteristicsof included studies. Variables’ categories regrouping was carriedout as following: authors’ affiliation was categorized into clini-cal departments and/or information technology (IT) departments;information on private sector involvement in the authorship wasacknowledged. Study setting was divided into surgery and emer-gency departments, intensive care units (ICU) or general hospitalimpatient setting. ML models were categorized in predictive – help-ful to detect real-time patients’ risk of HAI – and retrospective –helpful for surveillance and epidemiological analysis.With regard to the pre-specified outcomes of interest we quan-titatively retrieved:• HAIs surveillance models’ performance measures, expressed as:sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), nega-tive predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, and other per-formance measures;• HAIs’ clinical and organizational control indicators, expressed as:reduced HAIs’ incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, impa-tient length of stay and costs.Both performance measures and control indicators were pooledusing ranges and average values, grouped by type of infection(HAI in general, CLABSI, SSI, CDI, CAUTI, VAP and other specificinfections) and compared differentiating between ML and non-ML-based surveillance models. For studies that presented a comparisonof the performance of different ML models, we a priori decided toselect and extract data referring to the best performing algorithm.Anticipating variability between studies, and depending on dataavailability, we planned to apply – where relevant and possible– random effects analyses to acquire pooled performance andeffectiveness estimates for ML-based vs. non-ML based surveil-lance systems [25]. Included studies quality appraisal was carriedout applying: the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [26] for non-randomized studies and the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool forrandomized studies [27]. Included studies’ quality was not set asexclusion criteria. Disagreements by reviewers were resolved byconsensus.ResultsWe identified 3445 citations by searching the selected databasesand listing references of relevant articles.

Units of analysis included: number ofpatients, number of medical records, patient-days, hospital stay(days), number of procedures. Included studies’ sample sizes, dif-ferentiating between intervention and control, training test andtest sets are reported in Table 1. Sample sizes of studies havingpatients as unit of analysis ranged from 120 to 256,732 (median2081).ML algorithms assessed in included studies varied widely(Table 1): 17 (63%) ML approaches were classified as predictiveand 10 (37%) as retrospective.

Inables 2–4 we report performance measures for each assessed ML-ased model, performance measures of control models, groupingncluded studies by type of infections.L-based models for Central Line-associated Bloodstreamnfections (CLABSI) surveillanceTwo studies reported data on ML-based models applied toLABSI surveillance in, respectively, hospital and ICU settings30,39] (Table 2). Beeler et al. [30] compared a ML-random forestodel with non-ML traditional logistic regression model, (AUROCf 0.87 and 0.79, respectively) and validated the best performingL one to derive patients’ personalized daily risk of CLABSI. Parrecot al. [39] compared the performance of three different ML-basedodels, demonstrating Gradient boosted trees-ML model to havehe highest accuracy, precision, sensitivity and negative predictivealue. Overall, all ML-based models tested in Parreco et al. [39] had:i) high specificity and NPV, low sensitivity and PPV, and had lowerUROC as compared to Beeler et al. [30]. The application of Logisticegression (LR) models was different in the two studies, in Beelert al. [30] a static model was applied, instead in Parreco et al. [39] machine learning model of LR was applied. Both studies con-luded demonstrating the potential benefits of applying accurateL-based models for CLABSI real time/early identification and riskrediction.L-based models for sepsis surveillanceWe retrieved two papers reporting on ML-based models for sep-is’ detection: one using retrospective data to test and validate them32], while one assessing their impact on clinical outcomes in theontext of an experimental study design [40] (Table 2). Desautelst al. [32] showed a ML-based classification system using a mini-al set of clinical data to perform better than traditional scoringystems (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment – SOFA Score, quickOFA – qSOFA, Modified Early Warning Score – MEWS, Systemicnflammatory response syndrome – SIRS Score, Simplified Acutehysiology Score – SAPS score), both at admission (AUROC = 0.88,PR = 0.595), and 1–4 h preceding sepsis onset (Table 2), perfor-ance holding higher even with 60% randomly missing data. Aandomized controlled trial by Shimabukuro et al. [40] assessedhe efficacy of an ML-based sepsis detection algorithm on reduc-ng hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality, as compared toraditional automated sepsis score surveillance, reporting – respec-ively – a 20.6% and 12.4% decrease (Table 2). Overall, both studieseported ML-based models to detect sepsis more accurately thanraditional clinical scores, retrospectively for epidemiological anderformance evaluation purposes, and prospectively for preventiveeal-time evaluations.L-based models for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)We retrieved two studies reporting on ML-models to predictlostridium difficile infection in the US [33,38] (Table 2). Oh et al.38] contrasted the idea of applying static non-ML prediction mod-ls for CDI across institutions but, instead, propose a ML approach toerive setting-specific ML-based risk models for CDI and report per-ormance measures of two of them developed from retrospectiveealth data analysis with AUROC of, respectively, 0.82 at the Mas-achusetts General Hospital, and 0.75 at the University of MichiganPlease cite this article in press as: Scardoni A, et al. Artificial intelligsystematic review of the literature. J Infect Public Health (2020), httpsospital (Table 2). As authors comment, these ML-EHR-based CDIisk stratification models allow for earlier and more accurate iden-ification of high-risk patients and better targeting of infectionrevention strategies, with high specificity but high false positives PRESS Public Health xxx (2020) xxx–xxx(low positive predictive value, Table 2). Escobar et al. [33] compareddifferent techniques, including machine learning models, to pre-dict recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (Table 2); they selectedthree best performing models – of which one ML-based – butdid not report any discrimination advantage, or better calibrationor explanatory power, as compared to simple logistic regression(Table 2), leading authors to conclude that the use of ML modelsremains limited in CDI recurrence prediction.ML-based models for Surgical Site Infections (SSI)We retrieved eight studies reporting on the application of ML-based models to predict, control and assess Surgical Site Infectionsand their risk factors pre and post-surgery in European and USsurgery departments [35,37,41,43,45,47,49,53]. Performance mea-sures of different ML-based models are reported in Table 3.Two studies compared ML-models with standard logistic regres-sion models for SSI prediction in colorectal surgical patients [41,43]reporting higher performance of Bayesian network classifier usingdifferent set of variables (p = 0.002) in one study [41], while lesssupportive results were reported in the other [43] where ML-based models had higher performance than LR only prior to surgery[43] and only for specific ML classification methods (support vec-tor machines, Table 3). Promising results of applying ML-basedmodels to SSI prediction comes from neurosurgery [45], and headand neck surgery settings [47]. The use of Artificial neural net-works (ANN) algorithms showed good results in predicting SSI infree flap reconstruction, performing better in postoperative predic-tion [47]; similarly, Natural Language Processing (NLP) detectionapproach showed the highest detection accuracy for SSI infections[45] (Table 3). A multi-center study assessed the SSI predictivevalue of ML-based models incorporating data from daily clinicalwound assessment and reporting the best performing model tohave moderate PPV (0.35) and high NPV (0.93) for identificationof SSI in advance of clinical diagnosis [53]. Soguero-Ruiz et al.[49] explored different ML-based models (linear and non-linearSVM) for SSI temporal prediction fueled by blood test results andreported pre-operative and post-operative accuracy to range from,respectively, 0.69 and 0.67 to 0.91 and 0.90. Finally, a large USstudy developed and tested against the US National Surgical Qual-ity Improvement project (NSQIP) data prototype ML-based systemsto detect superficial, deep and organ/space SSI reporting them tohave high specificity (0.78–0.98) and high NPV (>0.98) [35]. Over-all, ML models’ sensitivity ranged between 0.42 and 0.80, specificityranged between 0.64 and 0.93, Positive Predictive Value between0.33 and 0.53, Negative Predictive Value between 0.87 and 0.99,accuracy between 75.8 and 90 and AUROC between 0.436 and0.896.ML-based models for Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs)Eight included studies reported on ML-based models for thecontrol of HAIs in general (Table 4), either to retrospectively iden-tify HAIs’ determinants and risk factors, or to prospectively predicttheir occurrence [7,28,29,44,46,48,51,52] (Table 4). Included stud-ies compared different ML-based models or compared them withnon ML models. Swedish data comparing two different ML-basedmodels, namely SVMs and GTB showed the latter to perform betterin terms of percent recall (93.7) and precision (79.7) [52]. Rela-tively high HAI detection performances of ML-based models werereported in the US [36], France (0.79 precision) [7] and Spain (0.70precision) [51] (Table 4). Studies conducted in China [48] on lungence-based tools to control healthcare associated infections: A://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.006cancer patients and Taiwan [46] compared ML-based models fedby Electronic Health Records data to LR and manual scoring mod-els reporting high discrimination power of ANN with AUC rangingfrom 0.79 to 0.85 (Table 4), although not statistically higher than ING ModelJon andLbccaciIrar0SpcpUaaweSrwtafnaDwspthpottms6seonftbdaapcoMidoARTICLEIPH-1375; No. of Pages 17A.

With regard to urinary tract infections,S data reported XGboost to perform best, as compared to other MLlgorithms, as well as compared to provider judgment, antibioticdministration and documentation of UTI diagnosis [42] (Table 4),hile data from a different study setting reported NLP-based mod-ls not to perform as well as standard surveillance methods [31].avin et al.

Overall, there is moderate evidence that ML-based modelserform equal or better as compared to non-ML approaches andhat they reach relatively high-performance standards. However,eterogeneity amongst the studies was very high and did not dissi-ate significantly in subgroup analyses, by type of infection or typef outcome. More than half of included studies were conducted inhe US and the majority of studies focused on surgical site infec-ions. Available comparative data are between different ML-basedodels and: clinical scores, standard or automated (rule-based)urveillance models and logistic regression statistical algorithms;3% of studies had a predictive approach, while 37% had a retro-pective approach to risks identification for HAIs.Digitalization is revolutionizing “the way humans create,xchange, and distribute value” [51], and rapidly shaping all aspectsf society, including healthcare [8,56,57]. In this context, there iso doubt that artificial intelligence tools’ application to the dif-erent fields of medicine will dramatically improve diagnostics,reatments and ultimately health outcomes. The adoption of ML-ased instruments in health has been taken up at different paces inifferent fields of medicine. As summarized in a recent review, thereas in which research on artificial intelligence is more advancedre: cancer, nervous system and cardiovascular diseases [58], withromising applications to, for example, cancer mutations’ identifi-ation [59,60], cardiovascular events’ prediction [55,61,62], amongthers. We have previously reviewed and pooled the application ofPlease cite this article in press as: Scardoni A, et al. Artificial intelligsystematic review of the literature. J Infect Public Health (2020), httpsL in orthopedics reporting a still preliminary – although expand-ng – phase of ML adoption, mostly linked to the use of imagingata [54]. More in general, the arguments around the applicationf AI in health are mostly framed around the concept of clinical PRESS Public Health xxx (2020) xxx–xxx 15decision support, or better said, around the concept of support-ing physicians in their tasks to take decisions “in the absence ofcertitude” [54] in clinical contexts. A public health perspective onartificial intelligence is less frequently adopted. We have recentlyargued that as public health in Europe and across the globe facessubstantial challenges – including the burden of HAIs and asso-ciated rise of antimicrobial resistance [63] – we should seek tobetter understand the potential of artificial intelligence use in sup-porting public health efforts [38,57]. How can ML tools supportemerging public health threats through preventive approaches? Inthe current paper we make the case of HAIs’ prevention and con-trol. From all the studies included in the present review -althoughlargely heterogeneous – it clearly emerges how ML-based modelswould allow for earlier and more accurate identification of high-risk patients and better targeting of infection prevention strategiesin healthcare facilities with ultimate decreased incidence and costs.Indeed, in a generalized context where hospitals are struggling tocontrol expenses, despite quality improvements in healthcare, HAIsremain a major cost. A meta-analysis published on Jama estimatedthat in the US the total annual costs for the 5 major HAIs is $9.8billion [8]. None of the studies retrieved in our review reported cost-effectiveness analysis on the application of ML-based interventionfor HAIs surveillance and control, a research area worth exploringin the near future. More in general, the field of cost-effectivenessanalysis of ML-based tools in healthcare is still poorly explored,some data support the cost-effectiveness of targeted screeningsusing a ML risk prediction algorithms [64] but solid evidence oncost-effectiveness of ML in the different areas of medicine is missing[1]. Almost all included studies provided performance measures ofnewly developed or adapted ML models while limited data is avail-able on their validation [65] and on their implementation in clinicalpractice. In fact, we could retrieve only one RCT that reported dataon the experimental use of a ML-based severe sepsis prediction sys-tem showing reduced average length of stay (−21%) and in-hospitalmortality (−12%). In addition, the single-center study’s relativelysmall sample size, the short study period limits the generalisabil-ity of its results. Overall, scant data is available on ML tools’ useand impact in clinical practice, this confirming that despite ongo-ing lively discussion around the potential of artificial intelligence insupport of healthcare delivery, evidence is still largely lacking. Ourdata demonstrate that research outputs are progressively accumu-lating on the topic, but we are still far from validation, adoptionand scaling up of ML-based models for HAIs control and almostno data exist on their impact on clinical, organizational or eco-nomic outcomes. A number of pillars need to be strengthened to getto widespread adoption of ML-based tools for HAIs control; theserelate to the availability of data and technical infrastructures, tothe development and validation of highly performing models andto the tackling of the normative, cultural, behavioral and organiza-tional determinants challenging their adoption. First, large volumesof electronic health data should be available, accessible and link-able so as to inform and fit machine learning algorithms. Indeed,the value of machine learning predictive algorithms is to unlock andmake meaningful use of large, complex data. The availability of elec-tronic health data varies widely across countries, regions and singlehealthcare facilities. In the US it is estimated that more than 90% ofhospitals have an electronic medical system in place [10], in Europethe distribution of the Digital Health Index that assesses Countries’digital health readiness lists Estonia and Denmark as preformingbest in Europe [67] while other countries lack far behind .

Overall,n line with what reported in the literature on automated surveil-ance systems [66], our data suggest ML-based models performanceetrics favor specificity and negative predictive value, more thanensitivity and other performance measures, thus underlining theotential of ML models to detect the non-infected subjects. Third,espite an ongoing fruitful debate around the potential for adoptionf ML-based solutions in healthcare, scant elements are available onormative, cultural, behavioral and organizational factors still ham-ering their adoption in infection control [68,69]. More in details,ow technological innovation will change the designing and imple-entation of HAIs surveillance and how this will modify the rolesnd functions of clinical staff and the organization of health serviceselivery? Data informing such reasoning is still scant [66]; the tran-ition from resource intensive conventional manual surveillanceacking standardization to semi-automated, automated and ML-ased automated surveillance should be modulated on the basisn the aims and scale of surveillance, differentiating, for instance,etween research purposes, in-hospital quality improvement, orational and international-level surveillance [66]. Despite poten-ial advantages offered by ML-based tools for HAIs surveillancen terms of reduced costs, improved quality and efficiency, theirntroduction has to deal with, among others, low acceptance byhe medical community and heterogeneity of hospital informationystems hampering benchmarking [66,70].Our review has both strengths and limits.

However, despite hav-ng meticulously extracted outcomes’ data, heterogeneity amongsthe studies prevented us from quantitatively pooling them in meta-nalysis.

Introduction The ongoing digitalization influences the society and business world, including the healthcare sector as a whole. For instance, the integration of health information technologies (HIT) in clinics such as electronic health records enables significant improvements in therapy, rehabilitation, or diagnostics [21]. However, this new technological opportunities also lead to challenges within clinics: Physicians have to deal with an ever-increasing amount of patient’s data created by digitized systems [4]. In addition, clinics currently face major societal issues: The high number of aging-related diseases caused by demographic change is—for example—further increased by the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis, so that the resources of medical personnel become progressively strained [27]. Artificial intelligence (AI) as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” [31:2] could help solving such challenges and makes it possible to technically solve tasks that were previously reserved for human intelligence [38]. Especially, machine learning (ML) as a subfield of AI is currently one of the most rapidly growing technological opportunities. Thus, in this research paper, we focus on ML, which enables information systems (IS) to improve themselves automatically through training experience [8, 23]. ML systems have the enormous potential to process complex patient data (e.g. medical images or text data) effectively, find hidden patterns in symptoms, and link them to possible diseases. In this regard, the use of ML systems for diagnostics could enable more profound and efficient diagnoses and could thus be decisive for life or death [18, 42]. However, ML systems also pose challenges, which prevents a wide-spread implementation in clinics so far [24]. This is particularly the case as ML systems differ from other HIT as they are able to adapt their behavior over time, operate as black boxes, derive results statistically, and can thus lead to erroneous decisions [8]. IS research has recently begun to investigate the chances and challenges of ML in healthcare. For example, it has been analyzed what ML systems can contribute to improve medical processes and, in particular, medical diagnostics [e.g. 19, 25]. Furthermore, technical research is being done to demonstrate the feasibility of ML systems’ application in medicine [e.g. 3, 29]. However, prior studies have not yet contributed sufficiently to an understanding of clinics’ adoption process of ML systems. In that regard, our research aims to identify: Which specific factors influence the readiness of clinics to adopt ML systems and subsequently implement such systems for medical diagnostics? To answer this question, we conducted a qualitative study based on interviews with experts working for clinics or their suppliers. In order to sort our key findings, we refer to the technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework and the framework of non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread and sustainability (NASSS) as a conceptual basis [12, 17]. Proceedings of the 54th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences | 2021Page 6317URI: https://hdl.handle.net/10125/71382978-0-9981331-4-0(CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) 2. Theoretical background ML systems are based on algorithms capable of extrapolating patterns from data [39]. The acquired patterns can then be applied to new data in order to make, for example, classifications. As a consequence, ML systems are able to solve tasks without receiving explicit instructions but by learning from training examples. These examples can either be labelled (e.g. symptoms and related condition) or without any annotation (e.g. symptoms), resulting in a respective supervised or unsupervised ML problem [8]. Due to the data-based learning approach, an inherent property of ML systems is that they can be adapted to new data and evolve over time if being retrained [39]. Reaching from prediction of patient traffic in clinics to support of therapies: ML systems can help solving various problems in medicine [42, 43]. However, one of the most prominent areas of application in research and practice are medical diagnostics [e.g. 35, 41]. In this context, ML systems (and especially deep neural networks) can help to identify patterns in medical data (e.g. in medical scans, pathology slides, electrocardiograms) and sort possible conditions according to their likelihood [18, 44]. A distinction can be made whether ML serves to take over entire areas of responsibility from doctors or to support them in their decision-making process. In the near future, ML systems will mainly be used as an intelligent decision support rather than to automate medical diagnostics fully [e.g. 18, 25]. In this sense, current practical examples such as Isabel Health (an ML based symptom checker) show that more and more of such assistive ML systems are presently finding their way into clinics [46]. These systems raise the hope of making medical diagnostics faster, more efficient, and consistent and thus more valuable since they are able to compare patients’ data with a database that is larger than any physician’s experience [18, 42]. However, the introduction of ML systems in clinics also poses major challenges as these systems highly differ from conventional HIT. ML systems learn from high volumes of data, instead of being explicitly programmed [39]. It is therefore imperative to share data across clinics to enable profound training of the ML system [18]. Provided that ML systems are based on appropriate data, they are able to prepare high stakes diagnostic decisions (e.g. by suggesting possible conditions) [25]. ML systems derive these solutions based on statistical methods, which leads to several consequences: Modern ML systems are not only becoming increasingly opaque, they also never lead to 100% accuracy [8, 25]. These properties are particularly problematic in a medical setting where patients’ lives depend on a profound diagnosis and the correct functionality of the ML system should be ensured at any time [25]. Given the specific characteristics of ML systems, a wide-spread adoption in clinics has not been achieved so far, requiring more detailed investigation by research [24]. In order to gain an overview of existing literature regarding the adoption process of ML systems in clinics, a systematic literature review was conducted and published by the authors [37]. Looking at the articles identified, it becomes clear that most of the publications do not include primary empirical studies to identify factors influencing the adoption process of ML systems in clinics. Furthermore, none of the publications based their research on pertinent theories in order to develop a holistic understanding of the adoption process in clinics. Even though, ML systems are highly relevant in medicine, there is thus a lack of empirical and theoretically profound research. Against this background, an investigation of the challenges related to the adoption process of ML systems in clinics is desirable. To gain deeper insights into this research field, it is important to differentiate that the adoption process of innovations in organizations consists of two main phases comprising: (1) The initial readiness for a technology and (2) its subsequent implementation within the organization [50]. Both steps are highly relevant to the success of a technology within an organization and should be considered as dependent from each other [45]. The two-stage adoption process is a complex, multi-dimensional process that is difficult to represent using a single theory. In line with the recommendations of Mayer and Sparrowe (2013), we therefore base our research on “two theories to address what neither theory could [explain] independently” [30:917]. We thus utilize two frameworks to investigate the factors that influence a clinic’s process from (1) the first readiness to (2) the implementation of ML systems. Accordingly, we chose to employ both (1) the TOE framework developed by DePietro et al. (1990) [12] and (2) the NASSS framework [17] as a conceptual basis. The TOE framework is widely used in IS research to understand the readiness of an organization to adopt a new technological innovation [e.g. 1, 47]. In this regard, it considers three domains: The technological, organizational, and the environmental context. Each context, in turn, comprises several factors that specify on the considered domain. Those are for example the characteristics of the investigated technology (technological context), the existing infrastructure within an organization (organizational context), or governmental regulations concerning a technology (environmental context) [12]. In the last few years, clinics are increasingly faced with technological change and have to decide which technologies are Page 6318 relevant to them [2]. In that regard, several studies have used and adapted the TOE framework to explain the factors that influence the readiness of a clinic to adopt an HIT, although the framework was not originally established for the healthcare industry [e.g. 22, 28]. Thus, we consider the theoretical framework to be a useful starting point to investigate what enables clinics to prepare for the adoption of ML systems. Presently, adoption research in health informatics started to look beyond the mere readiness and towards the implementation phase after the adoption actually took place [17]. In this context, ML systems own highly specific characteristics that will necessitate a significant change in the organization’s structure and working routines in the long run [8, 25]. Therefore, the implementation phase after the first readiness to adopt is just as decisive for the success of ML systems in clinics as the previous one. To capture this, we included the NASSS technology implementation framework as a second conceptual basis. NASSS has primarily been developed for the healthcare context by combining established health- and social care frameworks and can be used to analyze the implementation phase of an HIT. It includes seven domains such as the condition to be diagnosed and treated, the demand- and supply-side value proposition associated with an HIT, and the adopter system consisting of patients, their relatives and medical staff. Furthermore, it explicitly conceptualizes on the embedding and adaptation of the HIT within a clinic over time [17]. In summary, the factors of NASSS help to complement the TOE framework to account for the whole adoption process of a HIT in clinical processes. Since ML systems differ significantly from existing technologies and it is not sufficient to rely on either the basic TOE or NASSS framework [49], we seek to combine, adapt, and extend both frameworks in the following to gain a profound understanding about the specific factors that enable clinics to put ML systems into clinical practice. 3. Qualitative research methodology Our overarching goal was to identify the factors that are specific to the adoption process of ML systems in clinics and are not yet sufficiently covered by existing theories. We thus followed the steps of directed content analysis in order to extend the established conceptual framework based on TOE and NASSS. In that regard, we used both frameworks as a starting point that were integrated, adapted, and expanded taking into account the qualitative data [20]. To analyze and understand the highly complex process from a first readiness to a routine use of ML systems, an in-depth analysis was necessary. We therefore employed a qualitative approach to “see the world through the eyes of the actors doing the acting” [16:17] and conducted interviews with highly involved experts (N=15). We formulated a semi-structured interview guideline to lead the conversation and to ensure that all relevant questions are posed. Due to the qualitative approach, the guideline was kept open and flexible to allow adaptations to the respective interview partner, one’s position and knowledge base [33]. The qualitative data were collected from May to October 2019 within Germany. In order to identify suitable participants, we have searched for experts in social networks, on clinic websites, and at relevant conferences on ML in medicine. Qualified interviewed experts (N=15) were chosen, who have detailed knowledge of clinical processes, experience with ML systems, and are involved in the respective decision-making processes [7]. We consider the additional supplier perspective to be particularly useful to triangulate the data [9]. The various experts are clinics’ managers, physicians, and managers of diagnostic HIT suppliers. While three of the interviewed experts were physicians, six hold a hybrid position (i.e. physicians with additional leadership responsibilities), and six were full-time managers with medical education. As shown in Table 1, different medical disciplines were considered in the interviews (e.g. radiology, pathology, internal medicine) in order to allow for different perspectives on medical diagnostic processes (e.g. interpretation of medical scans, pathology slides, electrocardiograms) and obtain more generalizable results [5]. All experts had in common that they had prior knowledge on ML systems due to research work, pertinent projects, or product development processes.

While three clinics are privately financed, the others are public. Furthermore, all clinics and suppliers are currently running projects related to ML. On average, each expert interview lasted 49 minutes and took place in private space. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed after mutual agreement. In two interviews only, notes were taken as the participant refused audio recording. The transcripts were analyzed with the help of NVivo 12 software. We applied an iterative multi-cycle coding process that is in line with qualitative content analysis and that consisted of two coding cycles, between which we moved back and forth [40]. The first cycle comprised three different types of coding: Using attribute coding enabled us to receive descriptive information concerning the participant. Hypothesis coding was employed to consider the prespecified conceptual framework (i.e. TOE and NASSS) and to examine the suitability of existing factors regarding the adoption process (e.g. clinic’s size). In contrast, the descriptive coding approach allowed us to identify new aspects that go beyond the conceptual framework by disregarding formerly identified factors. Since the coding procedure during the first cycle has led to a large number of factors, we used pattern coding within the second coding cycle to pull together the codes into a smaller number of constructs [40]. During the research process, we employed several practices to obtain rigor and trustworthiness. To begin with, we defined a clear research question and conceptual framework that we used as input for our research design. Furthermore, we followed a theoretical sampling approach by iterating between data collection and analysis until theoretical saturation was reached after the 15th interview [15]. The resulting amount of interviews is comparable to other qualitative studies in IS (healthcare) research [e.g. 6, 19]. Besides, a multi-researcher triangulation took place. In that sense, coding was intensively discussed between the authors during the data analysis [9]. We also decided to include the voice of participants and thus quoted directly from the interviews while presenting our findings [10:182]. 4. Results and discussion of findings As diagnostic procedures can differ within the different medical specialties, the data analysis focuses on common factors that affect the adoption of ML systems for diagnostics in clinics and can be derived across all disciplines. The key findings are structured according to the TOE and NASSS framework in order to describe the holistic adoption process of ML systems. An integrative overview of all these factors can be seen in Figure 1. In this regard, the first three propositions (abbreviated: P) refer to clinic’s readiness to adopt ML systems for diagnostics, while P4-6 apply to the implementation phase. However, P7 shows the relevance of patient data for both adoption phases. Figure 1: Integrative overview of the findings In the following, we present and discuss the results of our data analysis. For this purpose, we structure our findings according to the domains technological, organizational, and environmental context as well as the adopter system, condition, value proposition, and the stand-alone domain patient data. Technological context. The characteristics of a technology are a factor that is already considered within the original TOE framework [12]. Nevertheless, as outlined earlier, ML systems encompass several highly specific characteristics, that cannot be compared to other technologies. Therefore, the existing general factor “characteristics” is not sufficient to capture the properties of ML and has to be specified further. As one sub-factor of ML characteristics, the interviewees point out the ‘lack of transparency’ of ML systems as a major obstacle for clinic’s readiness to adopt ML systems. ML systems based on neural networks can consist of multiple processing layers and up to millions of numerical weights hampering the comprehensibility of ML systems to humans [8]. Especially in high-stakes decision-making processes such as medical diagnostics, this can lead to major issues. In this context, the experts state that physicians need to know exactly, which are the critical features considered by ML systems and how identified patterns lead to conclusions to be able to assess the ML system’s recommendation and suggest an appropriate therapy. One of the experts underlines this aspect: “You will never make these existential decisions dependent on a black box, where it is not possible to understand what led to the recommendation” (C-06). Another sub-factor of ML characteristics is the ‘ability to adapt’ their functioning if being retrained on novel data. This can either become relevant when the ML Page 6320 system is transferred to another context (e.g. another clinic) or needs to be retrained after some time as for example new medical research results are gained or patients’ demographic structure shifts. Clinics thus have to deal with an opaque system that is able to change its reasoning, making the outcome of a ML system unpredictable. Accordingly, experts see the adaptability of ML systems as another factor that has to be addressed by clinics (S-01, S-03). In order to prepare for the adoption of ML systems, clinics need to have a clear strategy in place on how to cope with the opacity and adaptability of self-learning ML systems. We thus state our first proposition: P1: The characteristics of ML systems (i.e. lack of transparency, adaptability) will impede the readiness of clinics to adopt ML systems. Organizational context. Looking at the organizational context domain, three factors emerged during the interviews: size of clinic, medical directors’ ML support and clinic’s resources for ML. The size of a clinic is similar to an existing TOE factor that was also considered relevant in the context of ML systems. In this sense, experts emphasized that small clinics have usually less resources compared to large clinics, which could hamper their readiness to adopt ML systems (C-11). In addition, larger clinics care for a larger number of different patients and thus have access to higher amounts of patient data which is needed to train ML systems appropriately (S-01). Furthermore, experts state that the first decision to adopt ML systems for diagnostic processes needs to be supported by clinic’s medical directors to achieve financial and non-financial support for the new technology (C-03). In this regard, ML systems for medical diagnostics affect the core business of clinics and thus have a strategic relevance [49]. As medical directors develop the clinic’s strategy, they are responsible for paving the way regarding the readiness of clinics to adopt ML systems. This is in line with prior research that states the significance of medical directors’ support regarding the readiness of clinics for strategically relevant HITs [28, 47]. One of the most frequently stated factors within the organizational context are clinic’s resources to get ready to adopt ML systems. This factor incorporates three sub-factors which are either in line with the original TOE framework (i.e. ‘clinic’s technical infrastructure’) or newly added (i.e. ‘financing structure’, ‘expertise in medicine and data science’). In line with existing literature [34], some of the experts report that clinics frequently rely on a wide range of clinical legacy systems, which are often proprietary to the suppliers, not connected, and based on obsolete hardware: “The primary challenge […] is that the clinic usually consists of […] million proprietary systems that are not connected” (C-01). However, experts emphasize the importance of a high-performance technical infrastructure that can efficiently access data from different sources to achieve readiness for ML systems’ adoption (C-01, C-07). Therefore, clinic’s technical infrastructure could pose a major challenge for the introduction of ML systems. The interviewed experts furthermore point out the problem of the current financing structure of clinics, which leads to strict budgetary constraints (C-09). In this regard, an interviewee states that one part of their budget is assigned to daily costs such as medication. The other part of the budget can be used to purchase large-scale medical equipment like X-ray systems. Thus, the development and set-up of ML systems is not covered by either of the two parts and no specific ML budget can be claimed (C-06). Beyond that, there is a lack of personnel in clinics having both expertise in medicine and data science: “The shortage of medical specialists hits us twice as hard. We feel this at the medical professional side [...], but it is also very apparent at the technical side” (C-10). Both fields of knowledge are regarded as highly important for the readiness to adopt ML systems by the experts (C-01, C-10, S-02). While a medical background can help to identify relevant training data or to assess the suggested conditions of the ML system, technical expertise is needed to realize and train ML systems, as presently, nearly no out-of-the-box ML systems exist for the application in medicine, requiring clinics to develop ML systems by themselves (C-01, C-10, S-02). Therefore, specific expertise in the field of data science is needed in addition to the medical understanding in order to develop and set up ML systems in clinics. In sum, we propose: P2: A larger clinic size, medical directors’ ML support, and the availability of resources for ML (i.e. technical infrastructure, ML budget, expertise in the field of medicine and data science) will facilitate the readiness of clinics to adopt ML systems. Environmental context. With regard to the environmental context there are two relevant factors influencing the readiness to adopt ML systems: governmental regulations concerning ML and medical ethics. Governmental regulations are a factor already known from the original TOE framework. Nevertheless, the interviews revealed some particularities that are not covered by the general concept and are described below. Medical ethics is a factor that is not captured by TOE so far, but is identified through our study. In the field of medicine there are several governmental regulations which must be taken into consideration when adopting ML systems. The Page 6321 following sub-factors could be identified: ‘medical approval of ML systems’, ‘accountability’, and the ‘protection of sensitive personal data’. The experts draw attention to the fact that HIT offered on the market and used in clinics are subject to several laws. That includes the need for medical approval conducted by legal authorities or HIT suppliers themselves (C-03). In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for the admission of medical products. In Europe, the HIT suppliers themselves need to perform a conformity assessment procedure, e.g. based on the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) [14, 32]. As mentioned before, most ML systems are currently being developed by clinics themselves and have not undergone any approval process (C-03). However, legal approval of ML systems is not trivial, as the system can learn from new experience and adapt themselves as described above: “It is not obvious how evidence can be obtained for an [ML] model that differs significantly at the beginning, middle, and end of the study. If you want to approve a medical device today, you have to describe the intended use in detail” (S-01). This legal gap is also addressed by an official statement of the FDA that proposes a change to the current regulation to be able to approve adaptable ML systems [14]. A comparable position of the EU does not exist. Therefore, legal ambiguities could represent a hurdle for clinics to decide on the adoption of ML systems for diagnostics. In addition to the medical approval of a ML system, there is the question of accountability for diagnoses. The experts interviewed indicated that it is questionable who takes over responsibility, if the diagnosis that was prepared by an ML system is inaccurate (C-04, C-10). It is also unclear who can be held liable—the HIT provider, the clinic, or the physician who is providing the medical diagnosis. An expert underlines this aspect with the following words: „Then there are certainly […] legal problems, for example: who is responsible for the interpretation and possibly wrong results of the ML model?” (C-10). According to the current state of the art, ML systems cannot be held responsible for their output, since a registered physician is always obliged to validate and interpret the system’s results and to perform the final diagnosis (C-12). However, it would ease the decision of clinics to opt for ML system if there was a legal specification—especially if ML systems are increasingly able to automate steps of sensitive processes as diagnostics (C-10, C-11). Another sub-factor which could be identified as relevant for the initiation and adoption of ML systems for diagnostics is the protection of sensitive personal patient data. Patient data are considered as highly sensitive and are under special protection by national and international laws (C-02, S-02). For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe only permits the processing of health data, if the patient explicitly accepts or if the clinic can provide particular reasons [13]. Thus, the respondents emphasize clinics’ concerns to obtain the necessary patient data to train the ML system (C-02, C-08). Using ML systems for diagnostic processes fueled medical ethical concerns among the interviewees. On the one hand, ML systems are able to improve the efficiency and effectivity of diagnostics (C-11, C-12, S-02). On the other hand, the suggestions provided by ML systems are deduced based on statistical methods recognizing patterns in patient data that can be biased (C-11). Furthermore, experts claimed that ML systems that are fed with patient data could determine whether a patient tends to develop a disease. This type of medical application would contradict the “patient's right not to know” (C-11). Summarizing these remarks, we set up the proposition: P3: Uncertainties in governmental regulations, strict requirements for the protection of sensitive patient data, and existing medical ethics will impede the readiness of clinics to adopt ML systems. Adopter system. The NASSS framework suggests that the successful implementation of ML systems is strongly influenced by the individuals who are supposed to use the system or affected by their suggestions. In this context, two ML specific factors turned out to be relevant according to the interviews, which further specify the factor: threat to physicians’ professional identity and patients’ ML reluctance. Since ML systems have the ability to solve tasks that were previously performed by humans, physicians might feel interchangeable in their job (C-03, C-05, S-03). ML systems are trained on large sets of data, which exceed the experience of any single physician, setting new standards for medical diagnostics. In this regard, most experts are concerned that physicians could reject ML system for their daily work: ""As a doctor who may have ten or 20 years of experience [...], would I like to be taught by a machine [...]?” (S-03). These concerns have recently found its way into pertinent research, demonstrating the relevance of the topic [e.g. 25]. The majority of the interviewees state the importance of patients’ view on the use of ML systems for medical diagnostics. Even though a physician is still involved in the decision-making process, patients might refuse the use of an ML system as the physician may be influenced by suggestions for possible conditions that are derived statistically and could be affected by biases. Furthermore, personal sensitive patient data have to be processed in order to gain Page 6322 results. Therefore, experts state patients’ acceptance of ML systems as highly relevant for the implementation (C-02, C-04, C-10). We thus conclude: P4: The threat to the professional identity of physicians and patients’ reluctance towards ML systems will impede the implementation of ML systems in clinics. Condition. As specified within the NASSS framework, the patient’s nature of condition impacts the applicability of a technology. This does not only hold true for conventional HIT but is also stated for ML systems by the interviewed experts (C-02, C-07). Therefore, the nature of the condition and the according medical screening decides if ML can be applied to support a diagnostic process at all. Even though ML is considered a general-purpose technology [8], the experts see difficulties to use ML systems, for example, to recognize patterns of conditions in images of organs, which either differ vastly from person to person (e.g. female breast) or are in motion continuously (e.g. human bowel) (C-02). Thus, the use of ML systems will initially be limited to certain conditions: P5: The limited applicability of ML systems for the diagnosis of specific conditions will impede the implementation of ML systems in clinics. Value proposition. The value proposition is the third domain of the NASSS framework, we were able to concretize by analyzing the interviews. According to the experts, the implementation of ML systems could result in the creation of value for both the physicians and the patients (C-03, C-08, C-10). Implementing ML systems in their daily work enables physicians to improve the effectivity and efficiency of their diagnostics since they can base their decision on a broad data base that is evaluated within a few seconds (C-12): “If you have the choice among a pathologist who has already looked at 10,000 cuts […] compared to one who has created only 500 findings, whom would you chose? But […] AI has not only 10,000 but 500,000 findings in memory” (C-06). In this regard, ML systems that are for example based on image recognition algorithms can surpass the ability of the human eye to capture details and patterns in X-rays [3]. If used as a second opinion, ML system thus increase the quality of physicians’ work (C-02, C-09). Also, patients could directly benefit from a decision that is faster and more informed if physicians use ML systems for diagnostics (C-08, C-12). We thus propose: P6: The additional value for physicians and patients created through ML will facilitate the implementation of ML systems in clinics. Patient data. During the interviews, nearly all experts stated the availability of patient data as crucial for both the readiness of a clinic to adopt and implement ML systems for diagnostics. In this regard, patient data has to be available to develop and train the ML system in the first place and subsequently retrain it during use. This factor comprises certain sub-factors which are described in the following. According to the experts, most of the clinics generate high volumes of patient data through their daily diagnostic processes (C-03, S-01), which is basically positive since an appropriate ‘amount of data’ are needed to train ML systems [8]. However, interviewing the experts revealed that medical patient data are usually provided in a variety of ‘proprietary data formats’ since many disparate clinical legacy systems from different suppliers have to interact in order to enable physicians to provide laboratory tests, diagnostic images (e.g. X-rays), or clinical notes. These proprietary data formats are often difficult or impossible to convert, making the generation of consistent formats highly problematic (C-03). The problem of differing data formats in clinics has already been recognized outside the ML context, e.g. when adopting cloud solutions in healthcare environments [e.g. 48]. Nevertheless, it is particularly critical for the introduction and use of ML systems that the patient data can be processed in order to be able to train and retrain the system. Although first research has been conducted to allow for the transformation of different medical data types in one format [26], most clinics have not yet been able to implement unified standards for patient data in order to enable the processing and analysis by ML systems. Furthermore, patient data are often stored in ‘unstructured file types’ such as image, text, or video. Experts raised the concern that physician letters are frequently written in free text formats, which are filled with synonyms and can be individually interpreted. For example, personal formulations are used, such as the description of a tumor’s size as comparable to a walnut (C-01). Thus, the patient data are not only hard to harness and has to be transferred in a machine-readable format first (C-03), it also lacks common quality standards for patient data, impeding the extraction of generalizable patterns through ML. Clinics aiming to adopt ML systems to support their diagnostics should therefore establish a common language that physicians apply when creating free texts. Such efforts are already being driven by some national initiatives (C-12). Moreover, it has been strongly emphasized by the experts, that clinics, which want to use patient data to train ML systems, need to anonymize the sensitive data before processing it through an ML system (C-11). However, ‘anonymizing data’ might remove valuable information, which could be important regarding the final diagnosis. For instance, information about a person's residence could facilitate a diagnosis if a Page 6323 disease is more prevalent regionally (C-11). Therefore, it is necessary for clinics to find ways to anonymize patient data without losing relevant correlations. First steps are already being taken in technical research to balance the protection against the quality of sensitive data effectively [e.g. 36]. In addition, there is no ‘basic truth’ for a healthy patient as the human body is a highly complex, not fully understood system. Therefore, no standard for an entirely healthy human can be determined as every medical examination could be influenced by the selection of medical measures, undiscovered diseases, or environmental conditions (S-02). In this context, analyzing the quality of patient data is problematic: “A standard for ‘what is healthy’ is not defined” (S-02). According to the experts, the selection of the right training data is especially important in a healthcare context, since wrong diagnoses may have an impact on patients’ lives. This leads to another aspect of patient data, which has to be considered: their ‘representativeness’. Patients of clinics vary in many aspects—from an outer perspective (e.g. age, gender, hair color) as well as from the inner functioning (e.g. size of organs, blood values). If ML systems are predominantly trained based on a demographically or regionally distorted database, false conclusions could be drawn by the system. In this context, an expert raised the example of a ML system supporting the detection of skin melanomas, which is mainly trained on a sample of patients with a similar phenotype. Therefore, this pre-trained ML system cannot be easily transferred to patients of other ages or with other skin pigmentation (C-01). As training data for supervised learning need to be labelled by humans, the same could be said regarding the expertise and working philosophy of physicians, which could be highly heterogeneous depending on physician’s knowledge state and working environment (C-07, C-10). Another aspect that influences the availability of ML systems in clinics is the ‘digitization of patient data’. Even though high volumes of data are generated, many processes in clinics are still paper-based impeding the availability of patient data in a digitized form: “Data are often not digitized, much is still in paper files, not structured, which means that the data availability is really extremely [...] poor"" (C-03). This observation is in line with prior research concerning clinics who are lagging behind at using digitized technologies [e.g. 21]. As a consequence, the interviewed experts see the integration of an electronic medical record system as a prerequisite for the application of ML systems (C-12, C-03). Additionally, the availability of patient data is limited due to difficulties of ‘patient data sharing’. Although some experts state that their clinics already have some special data networks in place, most healthcare organizations are still not connected. To enhance the availability of patient data in order to train ML systems, more secure internal (within clinic) and external data networks (e.g. clinic-to-primary care) should be established (C-03). The availability of patient data is not only a factor that decides on the readiness of a clinic to adopt ML systems, but must also be guaranteed during implementation phase in order to feed and retrain ML systems. Therefore, we identify the availability of patient data as an overarching factor as it influences both the readiness and implementation phase: P7: The availability of large volumes of digitized patient data (that are structured, uniformly formatted, anonymized, and representative) will facilitate the readiness of clinics to adopt and the implementation of ML systems in clinics. 5. Conclusion ML has an impact on all areas of human life including the healthcare system. In this regard, ML systems offer the opportunity to make diagnostics more efficient and informed. However, in order to harness ML for such an application, clinics need to deeply integrate ML systems into their clinical practice—a challenge that most clinics have not yet been able to overcome [24]. Since clinics own highly individual, human-oriented processes, it is crucial for IS researchers to reflect on this specific context [11]. The prior research is lagging behind to provide empirically proven factors that influence the integration of ML systems in clinics for diagnostic processes. To address this shortcoming, we set up a qualitative study and structured our findings in an integrated overview based on the frameworks TOE and NASSS. Before we discuss our contributions to theory and practice, it is necessary to clarify the limitations of this study. Since we pursued a qualitative approach, our results are based on the expertise of 15 interviewees. In order to counter potential problems of generalizability, we have applied various criteria to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of our study (e.g. theoretical saturation, triangulation, inclusion of multiple medical disciplines). Nevertheless, it might be interesting for further research to perform a quantitative study to verify the stated propositions and validate the proposed framework (i.e. P1-P7). Furthermore, the interviews were conducted in Germany only. Since the healthcare systems vary across nations, interviewing experts from other regions could lead to differing results. In addition, the rapid development of increasingly advanced ML algorithms could lead to systems, which are able to not only Page 6324 augment but automate diagnostic processes. Investigating automated diagnostics could produce different findings, even though the results obtained in this study could provide first indications. Nevertheless, our study makes several important contributions. To begin with, it could be shown that the TOE and NASSS framework can be applied, but have to be integrated and expanded in order to explain the full adoption process of ML systems for diagnostics in clinics. On this basis, we are the first to provide an integrative overview of readiness and implementation factors regarding ML systems in clinics. The overview includes three propositions that affect the readiness of a clinic to adopt ML systems and three that impact the subsequent implementation phase to put these systems into clinical use. Availability of patient data is found to be overarching as it influences both the readiness and implementation phase. Therefore, we contribute to adoption research in health informatics, which has recently called to look beyond the mere readiness to adopt HIT in healthcare organizations and to emphasize its subsequent implementation [17]. In addition, our study holds important practical implementations. In this regard, the key findings could guide medical directors of clinics aiming to integrate ML systems within their diagnostic processes. For example, clinics are still lacking strategies to implement unified patient data formats, even though research efforts in this area already exist. Thus, our study could lay a foundation to avoid pitfalls that could occur during the readiness or implementation phase of ML systems in a medical environment. 6.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Implementation; Healthcare Organization; Barriers; Facilitators Introduction Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has been unquestionably acknowledged as a game changer in health care [1], even more so after technological advances in the field of machine learning (ML) have contributed to further expand the frontiers of its possible applications [2]. Compared to knowledge- or rule-based systems that automate established human clinical reasoning methods through a series of “if-then” statements [3], ML encompasses all the non-knowledge-based models that automatically (or semi-automatically) learn from the exposure to abundant quantities of data and detect patterns through explicit or latent recognition rather than conventional programming. ML is expected to serve primarily as a decision support tool to enhance rather than a replacement of human work [4], thereby providing healthcare professionals (HCPs) with improved predictions and rendering their decision-making process more accurate [5]. Despite some AI systems having already shown to be equal or even superior in performance to HCPs [6], full automation of a broad range of human tasks is expected to occur only at later stages. Whether ML is intended to provide inputs to human decision making or to act autonomously, these technological advancements do not automatically translate into clinical practice. The road to implementing ML applications in patient care is indeed ridden with several challenges, creating an inevitable chasm between ML and its clinical integration [7], [8]. Challenges for the implementation of AI systems, without an exclusive focus on ML, have been previously outlined, with a breadth of interdependent factors at different stakeholder group levels [9], [10]. For HCPs, core considerations pertain to the need for ML outputs to be meaningful inputs in their decision making and be explainable. ML algorithms are often associated with the so-called “black box” effect [11], [12]. The lack of transparency in data and outputs can be a significant concern for HCPs, as it hampers model interpretability (i.e., the possibility to understand or interpret how a given output has been produced), and explainability (i.e., the capacity of a model to be explained, even if not totally interpretable) [13]. ML applications and outputs are therefore likely to clash with the principles of evidence-based medicine, which instead lies upon the highest possible standards of interpretability and explainability. Concerns about the potential implications for accountability and personal responsibility regarding mistakes or computational misdiagnosis by ML applications present additional implementation challenges. At the patient level, fair implementation of ML applications necessitates continuous supply of standardized data to train, validate and incessantly improve performance and prevent algorithmic bias [9]. Notions of patient confidentiality and privacy should be reimagined entirely as data must be shared across multiple institutions to maximize their value and allow for improved algorithms [14]. Lastly, distinctive implementation challenges have been identified at the level of healthcare organizations, dealing with financial challenges and funding mechanisms, as well as issues related to the computational resources that are necessary to support the implementation of ML. Several implementation frameworks for healthcare technologies are on hand, but no widely recognized model addresses all the specific issues that are relevant to ML applications [15], [16], [17]. To date, research on ML implementation has been predominantly conceptual in nature, with an underreporting of empirical investigations into the specifics and consequences of implementation processes in real-life settings [18], [19]. Available studies have primarily focused on the quantitative impact of ML algorithms on health outcomes or accuracy, without examining the corresponding implementation processes [20]. Recently, Chomutare et al. conducted a scoping review to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ML from empirical studies [21], while Tricco et al. focused on the strategies adopted to implement ML tools in hospital settings [22]. However, additional inquiry is needed to determine whether the literature on the implementation of ML applications in healthcare adequately acknowledges the unique challenges encountered along the implementation process, as well as the strategies adopted to overcome them. Research Objectives This systematic literature review primarily aims to identify studies on the real-life implementation of ML applications in clinical practice and to synthesize insights about the features of these innovations and the processes deployed to facilitate their effective implementation. We set out to address the following research questions: 1. What are the characteristics of ML applications implemented in clinical practice as reported in the scientific literature? 2. What processes and strategies do healthcare organizations employ to foster the successful implementation of ML applications in clinical practice? Which factors are recognized as more relevant for the (un)successful implementation of ML applications? Methods Overview This systematic review adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [23]. The review was previously registered within the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number 403873. All the methodological details are provided in the published research protocol [24]. The most relevant aspects are summarized hereafter, with any deviations from the protocol duly noted. Positionality of the research team Positionality refers to how individuals identify with, and relate to, different social dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity [25], and as such is a relevant aspect to consider in qualitative research. To that end, the research team comprises five Italian white researchers (LMP, VA, AC, FP, GC). Broadly speaking, the team as a whole, composed of 60% females and 40% males, shares a common background in management studies, with focus on healthcare management. LMP is a PhD student who is working in the area of AI and ML under the perspective of the organizational implementation of AI tools in healthcare organizations. VA is a PhD student who has conducted prior research at the intersection between digital health and implementation science. AC has multi-annual experience in organizational studies and qualitative research focusing on issues related to innovations in healthcare and professional dynamics in healthcare organizations. FP is a young adult expert in digital health technologies, focusing on their regulation and value assessment. GC has multi-annual experience in organizational studies and qualitative research focusing on institutional dynamics, novel technologies, and professions. Eligibility criteria This review focused on empirical studies investigating aspects related to the implementation of ML applications within healthcare organizations. We adopted the definition of implementation as an “active and planned effort to mainstream innovation within an organization” [26], while healthcare organizations encompass all entities delivering health services, including hospitals, outpatient centers, primary care facilities, and public health institutions. Studies were selected based on the eligibility criteria defined in the research protocol [24] and summarized in Table 1. The recently updated version of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a commonly used model to assess factors influencing implementation and to explain barriers and facilitators to implementation effectiveness [27], [28], was used as one criterion for inclusion. Specifically, only studies that explicitly reported factors related to the CFIR domains of inner setting or processes were considered eligible for inclusion (Textbox 1). Textbox 1. Domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) I. Innovation - Domain that collects the characteristics of the implemented object from a multi-faceted point of view. II. Outer setting - Domain designed to capture factors that are inherent with the context where the organization exists. III. Inner setting - Domain which encompasses the characteristics of the organization in which the innovation is implemented. It includes both structural attributes, which characterize the inner setting regardless of the implementation, and features that are specific to the implementation. IV. Roles - Domain which refers to the individuals who have significantly contributed to the implementation and their characteristics. V. Implementation process - Domain that collects all the information on the activities and strategies adopted to concretely implement the innovation. Table 1. Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Study design Empirical studies illustrating the implementation of ML-based applications (e.g., experimental/quasi-experimental, observational, hybrid, simulation study designs, qualitative designs, case studies, etc.) Effectiveness research study designs, literature reviews, commentaries, editorials, opinion articles, study protocols, studies collecting perceptions on implementation and unrelated to specific ML-based applications Intervention Analysis of the implementation of ML-based applications by at least covering factors related to the inner setting or process domains based on the CFIR Analysis of the implementation of logic- or knowledge-based applications (e.g., expert systems), or of ML-based applications with no considerations related to the inner setting or process domain Stakeholder groups ML-based applications used at least by HCPs ML-based applications targeting patients and other non-clinical stakeholders (e.g., caregivers, policy makers, regulators) only Setting Hospitals, outpatients and other community care settings All other settings, including home care Timeframe Studies published from 2013 until March 2023 Studies published before 2013 Abbreviations: CRIF: Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research; ML: machine learning; HCP: healthcare professionals Information sources Literature searches were conducted in Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science and replicated in top-tier management journal databases. In addition, the reference lists of all included studies and of the reviews identified were scanned to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant literature. Grey literature was not considered. Search strategy The search strategy was developed by the research team through an iterative process and is based on four main concepts: (1) artificial intelligence; (2) implementation; (3) healthcare; (4) study design. Multimedia Appendix 1 contains the search strings used for each database. The general term “artificial intelligence” was used broadly to encompass studies that address AI and ML as synonymous terms. The search was performed in April 2023. Study selection and data collection process Two researchers (VA, LMP) screened the first 100 retrieved studies based on titles and abstracts. Once alignment over the inclusion/exclusion criteria was reached, the remaining records were independently screened by the two reviewers in equal parts based on title and abstract. Disagreements over final inclusions were solved with a third researcher (FP). Studies deemed eligible for full-text reading were assessed in-depth (VA, LMP, FP). Disagreements were resolved by dialogue with two additional researchers (GC, AC). The entire research team read all the studies included in the analysis. The data collection process was performed by three reviewers (VA, LMP, FP) who extracted data using an ad hoc Microsoft Excel sheet preliminarily developed by the research team. To ensure consistency across reviewers, the extraction sheet was tested by each reviewer and re-calibrated before starting the data collection process. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the research team, with final decisions reached by consensus. Data items Data items were extracted based on established classifications or schemes, when applicable [24]. These encompassed information on the papers (e.g., journal of publication, publication year), the ML application (e.g., name, brief description, main practice of use, level of autonomy, degree of integration with other technologies), and the implementation process (e.g., stage of implementation, geographical location, care setting, specific unit of implementation). Furthermore, factors influencing the implementation process were assessed following the five domains of the updated version of the CFIR. Quality assessment The critical appraisal of the studies selected for data synthesis was performed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT; [29]), a tool designed specifically for systematic reviews that include heterogeneous studies, as it allows to assess the methodological quality of five types of study designs (i.e., qualitative studies, RCTs, non-randomized studies, quantitative descriptive studies, mixed methods studies). Quality appraisal was performed by two researchers (VA, LMP), and disagreements were discussed and solved. The quality assessment represents a deviation from the protocol, which did not include this step. Data synthesis Given the significant heterogeneity across study designs, research objectives, and outcomes observed, as well as the expected predominance of qualitative studies, we opted for a thematic synthesis approach to capture and synthesize the salient attributes of the implementation process based on the CFIR constructs [30], [31]. The analysis considers findings from the data extraction process as qualitative data and includes summaries and interpretation of findings from the authors of the reviewed studies. Hence, direct quotes from participants were excluded in cases where the study employed qualitative data collection methods (e.g., interviews). We used both an inductive and a deductive approach. Following the three thematic synthesis steps, we initially reviewed each paper and highlighted relevant aspects through line-by-line coding to capture and collect key data. The coding process involved three reviewers (VA, LMP, FP). To identify recurring topics, primary codes were then compared, organized and labeled to derive descriptive themes reflecting their meaning. Descriptive themes were used to develop higher-level analytical themes. The formulation of descriptive themes and the following assignation to analytical themes was initially proposed by a researcher (LMP) and iteratively refined through discussion with two other researchers (VA, FP). The higher-level analytical themes were subsequently deductively redefined by the entire research team within the constructs of the CFIR, which served as the final theoretical framework guiding our analysis. Results Study selection We retrieved 3,520 unique records that were initially screened based on titles and abstracts. A total of 67 records were deemed eligible for full-text screening (67/3,520, 2%). Additionally, we identified 36 eligible records from manual search of reference lists of excluded literature reviews and full-text screened records. Out of the 103 papers analyzed in full-text, 69 were excluded and 34 were included in the review (34/103, 33%). The primary reason for exclusion was the focus of the intervention analyzed in the papers (53/69, 77%), as they either had a clinical or technical purpose without addressing factors related to implementation in an organizational setting or regarded non-ML-based applications. Figure 1 provides an overview of the selection process and the reasons for exclusion. Figure 1. PRISMA flow diagram Study characteristics Most of the studies documenting the implementation of ML-based applications were set in the USA (18/34, 53%). Other locations included China (4/34, 12%), Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands (each 2/34, 6%), Italy, Spain, Norway, Korea, India, and Austria (each 1/34, 3%). Papers selected for data synthesis were relatively recent, with only three out of 34 (9%) published before 2019. Outlets were mostly clinical and/or in the field of information technology (IT) (30/34, 88%), while the remaining four focused on managerial or organizational studies (12%). Most of the selected studies followed qualitative or mixed methods designs (22/34, 65%), often relying on methods such as interviews and case studies. Quality assessment in studies Quality appraisal of the selected studies was performed using the MMAT tool. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design, and different MMAT questions were used to assess their quality. Overall, 18 studies leveraged the questions of qualitative studies, seven of quantitative non-randomized, five of quantitative descriptive studies, three of mixed methods studies, and one of quantitative randomized studies. Overall, the quality assessment suggests a medium-good quality of the studies, with only 12.5% of the assessment questions uncertain or unclear (“Can’t tell”). The detailed output of the quality appraisal can be found in Appendix 2. Characteristics of ML applications Table 2 provides a general description of the ML-based applications implemented in the selected studies, while Multimedia Appendix 3 contains more detailed information on the characteristics of these applications. The most recurrent applications comprised predictive modeling algorithms, visualization tools and alert-delivering mechanisms. All the applications identified by our search were clinical practice applications, according to the definitions from the European Parliamentary Research Service [32]. Moreover, none of the applications had decisional autonomy; therefore, all systems could be classified as clinical decision support systems (CDSS). In terms of settings, ML-based applications were mostly implemented within hospitals (29/34, 85%), including general, university or teaching hospitals, academic medical centers, and research centers. A few studies (4/34, 12%) were based in a community or primary care setting. Within hospital settings, the most recurring implementation units were emergency departments (ED) (11/34, 32%) and critical care units such as intensive care unit (ICU) (4/34, 12%), while in some studies implementation occurred in multiple units or at the hospital level (5/34, 15%). The clusters identified by Rajkomar were used as a theoretical guide to classify the clinical workflow activities in which the ML-based applications were used [33]. In 20 studies (59%), the ML tools supported prognosis. Many of these applications were designed to predict the risk of developing specific conditions such as sepsis (8/34, 24%), in-hospital deterioration (3/34, 9%), intracranial hemorrhage (1/34, 3%), or hearth failure (1/34, 3%). Other applications predicted the risk of unplanned hospital admission or re-admission (4/34, 12%). Ten papers (29%) illustrated applications for diagnosis, either as standalone computer vision tools to detect diseases from diagnostic imaging (e.g., pneumonia from CT scans, large vessel occlusions from CT angiogram, child maturation from x-rays), or as diagnostic supports in emergency physician triage; three papers (9%) illustrated applications for treatment optimization and personalization. ML capabilities relate to the clinical workflow activities, with forecasting (i.e., the ability to find complex patterns in data and make predictions) being the most prevalent capability (19/34, 56%), as this function is typical of tools that predict the risk of an adverse event (12/34 forecasting tools are for prognosis). Instead, computer vision was exclusively included in the algorithms with diagnostic purposes, with all six computer vision tools intended for diagnosis. As for the level of integration with existing technologies, 17 ML-based algorithms (50%) were embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) or similar platforms (i.e., add-ons to the EHR software in use). Fourteen algorithms (41%) were standalone applications, fed either with internal or external data, including images or text. One application (3%) was embedded in the hospital hardware technology, namely scanner machines [36]. Computer vision applications were always standalone applications provided as software to be installed within existing hardware (i.e., hospital computers) and integrated with local picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). The ownership of the algorithms was also assessed, revealing a division between applications purchased from commercial vendors (14/34, 41%) and those internally developed (12/34, 35%). The latter were often linked with the organizational setting, as six of these studies were carried out in teaching hospitals, academic medical centers or research centers. Externally purchased applications were more common in other settings and exhibited greater diversity in terms of purposes, while homegrown tools were generally intended for prognostic purposes. In eight studies, information on the name or the development process of the application was irretrievable, preventing determination of algorithm ownership. Details on the specific ML models employed were often missing, although it is possible to infer that 20 of the analyzed studies (59%) were based on supervised learning models such as random forests, decision trees, or logistic regressions.

From the 34 studies analyzed, 222 quotes were extracted. Quotes were organized in 167 descriptive themes and 35 analytical themes. Analytical themes were finally embedded into 23 CFIR constructs. The detailed result of the coding process can be found in Appendix 4. To provide a simplified overview of the coding process, Table 3 summarizes the analytical themes, their correspondence with CFIR constructs, and relative frequencies. Results are reported according to the frequency of information extracted on CFIR domains. Table 3.

Relative importance of CFIR constructs (bubble size represents frequency) Note to Figure 2: the percentages represent the proportion of papers in which each construct and domain appear, out of the 34 included in the review. The size of bubbles corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of each construct. Inner setting The inner setting domain was the most frequently described, with 25 studies mentioning at least one construct from this domain as relevant to explaining the implementation process of the ML application. The most recurrent constructs were access to knowledge and information (12/34, 35%), IT infrastructures (11/34, 32%), and culture (9/34, 26%). First, the access to knowledge construct aligns with the topic of skills. Studies emphasized the importance or providing end-users with access to training programs on both hard and soft skills before implementation [50], [51], [57], [66], including computer and technical literacy linked with the complexity of the application’s functioning [59], [65], and the medical domain that the application addresses [47]. The latter referred to dimensions such as communication, empathy, and ability to listen, especially when different HCPs are involved in the implementation process [40], [41], [47]. Second, the IT infrastructure construct encompassed two prominent themes. The first broadly concerns data management and data governance. Themes such as data collection and quality [41], [60], [61], security [35], availability [38], [40], and sharing [41], [63] were highly described as challenges for adoption of the application. There were also significant references to building IT infrastructures [63] and to the need to integrate new technologies with existing IT systems (e.g., EHR). While integration promoted ease of use by reducing the need for manual inputs [49], [50], [52], some argued for the ML application not to directly populate EHRs to preserve HCP autonomy and prevent medicolegal accountability [61]. Finally, the construct of culture was articulated into the themes of professional habits and alignment of perceptions among stakeholders. The impact of introducing ML applications on professional habits was significant as this affected how professionals work, interact, and make decisions [64]. For instance, the habit of working without technological support was considered a barrier to implementation [41], [42]. The need for gradual changes in professional habits was seen as a factor that could hinder the adoption of ML applications in settings with high job rotations (e.g., teaching hospitals) [34]. Additionally, ML applications often are not tailored to local workflows, and do not consider the different approaches of professionals in diverse contexts [41]. The other theme related to culture was that of perceptions and expectations among different internal stakeholders (e.g., management, physicians, nurses, and technical staff). Misalignments among these stakeholders were common, particularly regarding trust in ML in general [47], [49], or the expected target users (e.g., residents vs. expert physicians) [47], [61]. Innovation The innovation and its characteristics were among the most frequently mentioned domains (22/34, 65%), with three constructs absorbing a significant portion of relevant descriptive themes: innovation design (15/34, 41%), relative advantage (14/34, 41%), and complexity (14/34, 41%). First, innovation design encompassed themes related to the applications’ design and functioning, including the types of human-machine interaction, as well as the associated risks. The most recurrent themes within this construct revolved around ease of use and intuitive design [35], [47], [51], [64]. The former was often linked to minimizing manual intervention, such as data input [51], [54], and was also associated with dimensions of trust in the applications, such as trust in the process and the cognitive burden for HCPs, in the form of fatigue from (over-)alerting [35], [64], which could be a barrier to professional buy-in [57]. Some studies explicitly cited the theme of human-centered design as a development framework that starts with the assessment of end-users’ needs and the environment in which the ML application will be used [56], [66], [69]. Another recurrent theme was the human-machine complementarity. For HCPs, it was often important to maintain a sense of control over the application and not perceive it as an attempt of uncontrolled substitution and automation [34], [35], [58], [67]. Human-machine complementarity was also associated with fewer disruptions to established workflows, enhancing the overall benefits associated to the use of a ML application [47], [55]. Moreover, complementarity could increase trust in the application, both from a micro-perspective (e.g., its functioning) [35], [56], and from a macro-perspective (e.g., the purpose of the application, and the reasons for choosing to integrate ML within a clinical context) [58], [60], [67]. The risks of ML use in decision-making processes also emerged. These included the risk of automation, in terms of overreliance on ML recommendations [41], and the risk of bias, tied to the underlying data and training model of the ML application [61]. Moreover, potential negative consequences of automation risk on clinical ability were mentioned [56]. Second, the relative advantage revolved around the perception of benefits and costs associated with the use of ML, as well as factors influencing trust in its performance. The most frequently perceived benefits were related to the organizational dimension, in terms of optimization of the workflow resulting from the elimination of unnecessary steps [45], increased attention from end-users to all cases managed by the application [47] and enhanced interactions among physicians and other HCPs [64]. Conversely, references to the economic impact were ambiguous. On one hand, faster decision-making could be considered a potential advantage [49]; on the other hand, human-machine interaction could also lead to a loss of efficiency compared to human intervention only [42], [58]. Another barrier to professional buy-in is that the perceived poor ability of the application to take contextual factors into account calls into question its clinical relevance Among the perceived advantages, trust in the application’s performance and its determinants were often commented on. For the analysis, the concept of trust was declined as already done by Hengstler et al. [35] who distinguished between trust in technology and trust in those who produce it (i.e., the source of innovation). Trust in technology is further divided into three dimensions: trust in performance, focusing on the accuracy and consistency of the output; trust in process, concerning the understanding of the reasoning behind a given output, and trust in the purpose of the innovation to be implemented [16], [46]. Concordance significantly influences trust in performance: the greater the difference between human judgment and machine recommendation, the lower the level of trust in the recommendation [46], [49], [60]. Similarly, recommendations that did not arrive in a timely or adequate manner negatively influenced performance trust [39], [46]. Additionally, trust in performance could be fueled by experience, the application’s ability to identify cases missed by humans, and the consistency over time of recommendations [49]. Third, innovation complexity highlighted the concepts of explainability and opacity as distinctive features of ML models. Many studies agreed in identifying algorithm complexity as the primary barrier to trust in the process underlying the generation of an ML output. This is even more true when non-medical professionals (e.g., nurses) interact directly with the ML application [47]. Facilitating interpretability, explainability or cognitive compatibility were mentioned as ways to promote transparency, HCPs’ trust, and professional buy-in [51], [57], [58], [60], [61], [67]. Implementation Process Reviewed articles often mentioned the characteristics of the implementation process (22/34, 65%), with a particular emphasis on the constructs of stakeholders engaging (12/34, 35%), reflecting and evaluating (11/34, 32%), and tailoring strategies (9/34, 26%). Attracting and encouraging the participation of different stakeholders in the implementation process emerged as a recurring theme. The practice of early involvement of end-users was frequently cited, not only during the implementation process but also throughout the development phase [35], [40], [47], [48], [60], [63], [65]. This was positively associated with trust in the innovation’s purpose [48], the application’s functioning [60], [63], [64], and the ease of use of its design [47]. During the implementation phase, stakeholder engagement was linked to evident benefits, such as improvement in the implementation climate [48], greater willingness to adopt the role of implementation leader [40], greater professional buy-in [53], [57], and better iterative collection of information and feedback [62]. Conversely, the absence of engagement was seen as a barrier to successful implementation, potentially leading to increased resistance toward the innovation among end-users [64]. In the construct of reflecting and evaluating, feedback and feedback loops emerged as recurring topics, with many studies underscoring the importance for both ML developers and the implementation teams to incorporate end-users’ feedback on either technical issues, system design, or clinical needs [36], [38], [40], [51], [64], [67]. Some studies noted that feedback collection extended beyond implementation, with structure feedback loop processes integrated into routine use [48], [50]. Regardless, feedback collection was described as an iterative activity [48], [50], [62], [63], which also positively influenced professional buy-in [49]. However, a critical point raised was that end-users may lack the necessary technical skills to provide feedback conducive to improvement [64]. Two additional recurring constructs were tailoring strategies and adapting. The former referred to actions addressing barriers and leveraging facilitators, while the latter involved modifying the innovation itself to best fit the context in which it was inserted. Among tailoring strategies, the importance of effectively communicating the implementation efforts was often highlighted. Some works referred to the need for clearly framing communication around the expected benefits, positively affecting trust in ML-based innovations [35], [40], [47], [48], [49], [56], trust in the innovation source [35], and fostering greater professional buy-in [57]. Another aspect of framing was related to the terminology used, asserting that using terms supporting concepts such as ""assistant"" or ""support"" had a favorable impact on end-users’ trust toward ML-based innovations [48], [49] and the innovation source [35]. In terms of adapting, the first theme involved the need for collected feedback to be effectively incorporated in the application, adapting systems to the local context of implementation [38], [60]. The second involves the issue of data, emphasizing the importance that the model is effectively trained and adapted to the cases treated in the clinical context in which the application will be used before deployment. The absence of this aspect was perceived as a barrier to trust in the ML application’s performance [41], [43], [46], [53]. Individuals: roles The sub-domain of roles was less frequently observed (11/34, 32%) and encompassed two constructs: implementation leads (9/34, 26%) and implementation teams (7/34, 21%). The former referred to the individual or group that guided and oversaw the implementation process, and their presence was generally considered a positive factor for implementation as it contributed to establishing a favorable implementation climate [49]. Individual implementation leaders were often referred to as champions. Although it may theoretically involve figures that emerge from bottom-up processes, all works referring to this role mentioned a top-down identification [47], [49], [64], [65]. Implementation teams were observed as well, in the form of quality improvement teams [36], AI governance committees [42], [48], [65], or interdisciplinary teams of HCPs, software engineers, developers, IT specialists, and other figures [48], [53], [57], [66]. Outer setting The outer setting domain emerged poorly in the revised studies (9/34, 26%), particularly in the form of three constructs: policy and laws (6/34, 18%), local attitudes (4/34, 12%), partnership and connections (4/34, 12%). In the policy and laws construct, three main themes emerged. The first concerned the medicolegal responsibility for decisions made using a ML application [41], [63]. The second pertained to regulatory and certification aspects, with recognition of the application as a medical device (MD) seen both as a factor positively influencing trust in the application [35] and as a barrier for utilization [48]. Regulations on personal data protection were also considered implementation challenges [49]. Regarding policies, the only theme mentioned was the relevance of national policies and guidelines to create a common framework for the implementation of ML applications [52]. Local attitudes were societal expectations and beliefs on the use of ML applications. Cultural aspects, innovation attitude, and public expectations could influence the acceptability of ML [37], [41], [52]. Equally relevant for acceptance was the visibility of the application, – i.e., how noticeable and observable an innovation is to the public – that influences how organizations foster innovation trust [35], [70]. Within the partnership and connections construct, building partnerships with scientific societies and professional communities was considered a facilitator for implementation, as these can act as knowledge platforms/hubs [44], [49]. Professional communities and peers could also trigger external pressure that may positively impact the willingness to implement ML applications [56]. Establishing development networks across hospitals and healthcare facilities was a relevant factor for the increased reliability of the application, providing the opportunity to leverage larger datasets which are known to end-users [63]. Moreover, forging public-private partnerships was deemed a useful step for implementation, to leverage expertise not always available within (public) healthcare organizations [52], [63]. Discussion Review of the main findings This work aimed at synthetizing extant academic knowledge on the implementation of ML-based applications in clinical practice, focusing specifically on the characteristics of the innovation and on the processes and strategies employed by healthcare organizations to ensure their successful implementation. We identified 34 studies reporting on the implementation process of as many ML applications, all of which were CDSS frequently based on supervised learning models in the form of predictive algorithms, visualization and alert-delivering tools. Overall, half of the observed applications were integrated in hospital information systems as add-ons to the EHR infrastructure. ML-based applications were mainly implemented in hospital settings and supported prognostic activities, although a relevant portion was intended for diagnosis. Among the diagnostic applications, those based on computer vision were either standalone software or embedded in the hospital hardware technology. Algorithms could be clustered in two groups: those internally developed, prevalently by university hospitals and academic medical centers and typically with a prognostic purpose, and those purchased from commercial vendors, more heterogeneous in terms of purposes and functions. Furthermore, our analysis enabled us to scrutinize the characteristics of the implementation processes of ML-based applications, gathering pertinent insights relevant for their successful integration within healthcare organizations. Through the theoretical lens of the CFIR, we identified a predominant emphasis on three key domains: the inner setting, innovation characteristics and the process dimension. First, evidence from the inner setting domain highlighted the importance of addressing IT infrastructure and data management challenges, as well as the necessity of fostering an organizational culture that favors the implementation of ML-based applications. Second, in terms of innovation design, the concept of human-machine complementarity was recurrent, highlighting the importance of integrating ML-based applications into existing workflows to enhance overall benefits and foster trust by ensuring HCPs maintain a sense of overall control. In the process domain, studies emphasized the importance of fostering early stakeholder engagement during the development and pre-implementation phases, adapting strategies to local contexts, and initiating reflection and evaluation activities to support continuous improvement based on feedback loops. Conversely, while the complexity inherent in ML models in terms of algorithm opacity was largely acknowledged, we found limited investigation into effective mitigation strategies to tackle these challenges. Comparison with prior work Differently from prior work encompassing also logic-based and rule-based applications [10], [71], [72], our study focused exclusively on ML-based applications. While the frequency and relative significance of the various application types are not directly comparable with those observed in the cited works, other recent reviews have adopted a similar approach to ours. In their scoping review, Chomutare et al. identified 19 studies on the implementation of AI applications powered by ML, highlighting a variety of solutions across medical fields and tasks within the clinical workflow [21]. Similarly, Tricco et al. explored how implementation science strategies can facilitate the implementation of ML tools [22], but their work also included studies with effectiveness research designs, thereby adopting a partially different approach from that of this work. Our review expanded the number of included studies, confirming the multitude of diverse applications of ML in clinical practice. The only condition for which we observed a conspicuous number of studies was sepsis, a dysfunction accounting for around 20% of deaths worldwide [73], for which ML-based applications are proliferating [74], although no definitive causal link with reduced mortality has been demonstrated to date [75]. Our search identified eight studies on sepsis, showcasing the potential attributed to ML-based applications in supporting the timely identification of hospital-acquired conditions. On a similar note, a recent review encompassing over 10,000 ML applications in healthcare settings corroborates the relevance of prognostic algorithms among those in use [76]. Consistently with previous research [21], [71], most of the included papers presented cases of real-world implementation rather than being proper implementation studies on the later phases of roll-out, often covering only a few aspects of the implementation process. While we hypothesized that distinct implementation strategies would be prevalent based on the characteristics of the ML-based application, we only observed limited distinctions based on the type of clinical applications (prognostic, diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes), or their development process (internal development vis-à-vis external acquisition and adaptation). For instance, the integration with existing IT infrastructures introduced ambiguity in the context of diagnostic applications, where such integration may be perceived as a risk with medicolegal implications [52], [61]. On the other hand, for applications with non-diagnostic purposes, integration with existing IT systems was viewed as a positive factor for ease of use [49], [64]. Other elements appeared relatively more pronounced in applications provided by external providers. This includes perceived risks associated with application design (e.g., overreliance, automation, bias) [41], [56], [61], considerations regarding complementarity with HCPs [35], [55], [56], [58], and aspects related to explainability. As such, exploring whether and how different application types entail different implications for their effective integration into clinical practice might be a valuable suggestion for future research. Just like Chomutare et al. [21], our work confirmed that the outer setting domain was largely overlooked, although prior studies have highlighted the importance of external factors such as data privacy and security laws, ethical issues, regulatory frameworks, and medical liability in implementing ML applications in clinical practice [5], [77], [78], [79]. The limited relevance of such domain in our sample may stem from two reasons. First, due to the nature of the included studies, only a few used frameworks accounted for elements beyond the organizational setting in which the implementation occurred. Factors associated with the outer setting may be more frequently highlighted in implementation processes perceived as unsuccessful, which are less often reported in the scientific literature. Second, since the primary studies predominantly involved HCPs, they did not incorporate managerial and policymaker perspectives. In fact, when the outer domain perspective was explored, non-clinical stakeholders were often involved [41], [49], [63]. Furthermore, Hogg et al. suggested prioritizing the perspective of non-HCP stakeholders in primary studies to enhance understanding of implementation processes at a broader level [10], which may serve as further valuable suggestion for future studies. Implications for the implementation of ML-based applications: a focus on trust The importance of trust, particularly within the physician-patient relationship, has been heightened by the advent of digital health, especially with innovations such as ML applications that heavily rely on data [80]. ML applications based on computational models are often characterized as opaque (i.e., black boxes), introducing an extra layer of complexity to the trust relationship between end-users and technological innovations [81]. A recent review by Adjekum et al. categorized factors influencing trust in digital health systems into personal, technological, and institutional elements [80]. Building upon the concept of trust as articulated by Hengstler et al. [35], our work contributes to understanding the determinants of trust in facilitating the implementation of ML-based applications in healthcare organizations. We observed that the characteristics of the innovation itself significantly challenge trust in the performance of ML-based applications. The complexity and opacity of the underlying models constitute primary barriers to trust, with trust in performance further influenced by system design elements such as ease of use, the nature of HCP-machine interaction, and the timeliness and consistency over time of recommendations. Additionally, considerations regarding data governance for internally-developed applications and the reputation of the technology provider for procured solutions further influence trust in the performance of these applications. However, as trust primarily remains a human-led process, factors beyond mere technical and mechanical characteristics influence trust in ML. While most of the observed implementation strategies were essentially ML-agnostic, addressing the issue of clinician trust should theoretically require dedicated, ML-specific processes. Our review highlights potential ways to enhance the application perceived reliability of ML applications. On the one hand, tailoring and adaptation strategies, early end-user engagement, and appropriate framing of ML-based applications as decision-support tools might favor HCP trust in both the application’s performance and its purpose [21]. On the other, specific tailoring strategies should be adopted to increase the explainability of the non-totally interpretable models [13]. For instance, Jauk et al. enhanced clinical reasoning using a web application presenting relevant features from ML-modelling [51], Davis et al. allowed radiologists to interact with the ML system by showing the types and locations of the abnormalities identified by the algorithm [55], and Henry et al. decided to delay alerts until the first verifiable symptoms were present in an attempt to increase acceptance [56]. However, these tailoring strategies may not be practicable when ML systems reach opacity levels that render the interpretation of their outputs impracticable. In such cases, other contributions have emphasized the need to highlight the level of actionability of ML models, in terms of their ability to enhance medical decision-making compared to clinical judgement alone, to power trust [82]. An additional contribution to enhancing trust may be achieved through continuous HCPs’ involvement. This involvement, which generates engagement and professional buy-in, is equally significant for the successful implementation of these innovations. In the realm of digital health interventions, while there is frequent emphasis on patient engagement in the design of solutions, the empowerment of HCPs is often overlooked [83], [84]. Active involvement of HCPs and frequent communications to raise awareness have been unambiguously identified among the most common enablers of trust in previous reviews on the implementation of ML applications [21], [22], [75]. This may facilitate the implementation of innovations by improving the implementation climate reducing resistance to change, and mitigating specific barriers associated with the complexity of ML models and the reliability of the recommendations they produce. Limitations This study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting our findings. Firstly, the rapidly evolving nature of the field of ML and the exponential growth of newly published studies posed a challenge in managing the vast volume of retrieved records. To address this, our search strategy incorporated a supplementary block of keywords focused on “study designs”, which may have excluded certain relevant articles. Additionally, our emphasis on peer-reviewed studies introduces a potential bias, as ML-based applications reported in the scientific literature may only represent a subset of implemented systems. This could impact the generalizability of our findings, as acknowledged in similar studies such as Sharma et al. [71]. Lastly, the decision to include only papers published in English might have led to the exclusion of valuable sources published in other languages, limiting the comprehensiveness of our review. Conclusions Despite a relative dearth of primary studies on the implementation of ML applications in healthcare organizations, the available evidence reveals the abundance and heterogeneity of factors involved when ML applications are introduced in routine clinical practice. While certain elements, such as complexity and trust, tend to emerge as distinctive factors for ML applications, many other aspects reflect what is already known about the implementation of digital technologies, particularly traditional CDSS. Further research is needed to bridge the gap between the theoretical potential of ML and its actual use in healthcare organizations. Identifying the distinctive factors that can facilitate its implementation will build theoretical and practical knowledge for healthcare practitioners, ultimately promoting the uptake of ML in routine clinical practice.

Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) defines healthy aging as the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age (World Health Organization, 2019). Cognitive health is one of the most important determinants of functional ability of older adults (Beaton et al., 2015; Dodge et al., 2005; Gross et al., 2011), is critical to aging with autonomy (Depp and Jeste, 2006; Willis et al., 2006). Healthy aging is associated with some cognitive decline in select abilities (e.g., processing speed, fluid reasoning, episodic memory (Der et al., 2010; Eckert, 2011)), a proportion of older adults develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI; labeled mild neurocognitive disorder in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)), and 5%–15% progress to dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) annually (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Mitchell and Shiri- Feshki, 2009, 2008; Petersen, 2011). Worldwide, 50 million people have dementia (World Health Organization, 2019). As there is no known cure for dementia, tools for the earliest possible detection of cognitive decline are necessary to achieve the greatest impact of current and novel treatment approaches to delay pathological cognitive aging (Graham and Depp, 2019). Unfortunately, early detection of cognitive impairment is a chal- lenging psychometric endeavor due to the insidious progression of symptoms, which, in the early stages, may be mistaken for normal age- related cognitive impairment (Deary et al., 2009; Petersen et al., 2001). MCI can be difficult to clearly identify, due to multiple sets of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2019.112732 Received 9 October 2019; Received in revised form 4 December 2019; Accepted 7 December 2019 ⁎ Corresponding author at: 9500 Gilman Drive, Mail Code #0664, La Jolla, CA 92093-0664, United States E-mail address: djeste@health.ucsd.edu (D.V.

T diagnostic criteria and need for longitudinal follow-up (Brodaty et al., 2017). Furthermore, MCI may precede varying types of dementia and does not lead to dementia in a sizable proportion of patients. Knowing which patients warrant a comprehensive cognitive screening can be challenging for clinicians, and neuropsychological test batteries are time-consuming and require trained administration. An ideal diagnostic tool must be sensitive to the earliest signs of cognitive decline, non- invasive, practical, and scalable for use in clinics worldwide. Similar efforts are already underway (Balota et al., 2010; Patten et al., 2018; Silverberg et al., 2011) with incremental progress, but there remains much room for improvement. The purpose of this conceptual review is to provide a primer for clinicians on the understanding and use of an exciting new approach to supporting clinical decision-making such as diagnosis, prediction, and differentiation between the various types of MCI and dementias – i.e., artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to the scientific field within the discipline of computer sciences concerned with building systems or machines (computers) to accomplish tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as making decisions. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP) are techniques of AI. For a machine to act intelligently, it needs to learn from data (trained with data). In ML, algorithms are used to enable the machine to learn through structured data input and past experience to detect pat- terns in the data and use uncovered patterns to predict future human data. ML can be supervised (i.e., tested against dependent variable data that are known or labeled) or unsupervised (i.e., with data that are unknown or unlabeled). DL is a subset of ML that is useful when there is a large amount of complex and unstructured data. DL involves multiple layers of algorithms called artificial neural networks (ANN), each pro- viding a hierarchically different interpretation to the data. NLP is fa- mily of techniques that focuses on analysis of natural human language (usually written) and can be integrated with any of the ML approaches. AI applications specifically for drug discovery, causal disease modeling, clinical trials recruitment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms are outside the scope of this review and have been previously examined in the literature (Jiang et al., 2017; Zhavoronkov et al., 2019). 2. Artificial intelligence primer for predicting and detecting cognitive decline AI in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms and software that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex structured and unstructured medical data like images or clinical notes (Jiang et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018). AI tools use these high-dimensional (i.e., multi- feature) data to determine potential predictors of normal versus pa- thological changes in cognitive functioning. AI analytic techniques are ideally suited to handle large volumes and complexity of datasets and can do this more efficiently than humans (Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2014; Wang et al., 2016). Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves various methods of enabling an algorithm to learn from datasets, or update itself based on new data (Chen et al., 2017; Nevin, 2018). Standard statistics emphasize fitting a specific model and hypothesis testing to understand underlying mechanisms. In contrast, ML algorithms do not require a priori hypotheses about re- lationships among variables, and instead, emphasize prediction accu- racy and can often detect unforeseen relationships and complicated nonlinear interactions within data (Graham et al., 2019). The results or “performance” of an AI algorithm depend on the model selected, available data, and the input features the researchers selected to predict an outcome. Below we narrate the most common classes of ML used for healthcare purposes: supervised and unsupervised machine learning (SL and UL) (Bzdok et al., 2018; Fabris et al., 2017; Miotto et al., 2016), and deep learning (DL) (Esteva et al., 2019; Miotto et al., 2017) (Fig. 1a), which may or may not involve natural language processing (NLP) (Demner-Fushman et al., 2009; Hirschberg and Manning, 2015) (Fig. 1b). Supervised Learning (SL) approaches require pre-labeled data (e.g., diagnosis of cognitive impairment vs. unimpaired) that serve as known outcomes for training an algorithm along with features derived from additional datastreams (e.g., clinical notes, neuroimaging) (Bzdok et al., 2018; Fabris et al., 2017). The algorithm then determines which features are most predictive of the pre-labeled outcome. The diagnosis of cognitive impairment could be based on either categorical classifi- cation (yes or no) or continuous regression (e.g., score on a neurocog- nitive assessment) (Fig. 1a). The validity of SL algorithms rely heavily on the “ground truth” behind the labeled outcomes, which may require longitudinal follow-up or other information to bolster the determina- tion of outcomes such as cognitive impairment. Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithms are provided with unlabeled data. While the data may contain, for example, individuals with cog- nitive impairment and those without, the algorithm is not privy to this information (Miotto et al., 2017). Instead, the algorithm searches un- structured data (e.g., clinical notes) for relationships or clusters with the goal of segmenting the data by some shared characteristics, or de- tecting anomalies that do not belong to a particular group. Identified clusters generally require clinical expertise to derive their meaning (Fig. 1a). Deep Learning (DL) functions using both SL and UL but is capable of exploiting the unknown structure from data using artificial neural networks (ANNs) that automatically derive features from raw data (i.e., feature engineering) when they learn, instead of requiring human input for obtaining features from raw data (Esteva et al., 2019; Miotto et al., 2017). This type of learning requires very large datasets in comparison to other forms of ML that can work with smaller data size and extensive computation power. Complex, high-dimensional data like neuroima- ging and speech are well suited to DL (Fig. 1a). Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to how computers un- derstand natural language (e.g., speech, text) in terms of language translation, semantic understanding, and summarization (Demner- Fushman et al., 2009; Hirschberg and Manning, 2015). The process of NLP is to transfer text from an unstructured into a structured format to enable analyzes. Studies that use NLP generally follow with one of the aforementioned learning techniques (SL, UL, DL) to determine the ac- curacy of using speech/text data to model cognitive function (Fig. 1b). 2.1. Performance metrics of AI results AI studies most commonly report results of algorithm performance as percent accuracy and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC). Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions: true positives + true negatives divided by all observations (true posi- tives and negatives + false positives and negatives) (Hossin and Sulaiman, 2015; Huang and Ling, 2005). In comparison, AUC provides information about the tradeoff between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) at various threshold settings. The benefit of using AUC instead of, or in addition to, percent accuracy, is that unlike accuracy this metric is not affected by class imbalance (e.g., a smaller number of subjects in the sample with dementia compared to healthy controls) (Hossin and Sulaiman, 2015). When evaluating the efficacy or quality of the results of AI studies, we should pay close attention to the validation methods used to arrive at the performance metrics. A study has been internally validated if methods like cross validation (CV) were used. CV is considered “in- ternal” validation because all of the data are used at some point in the training phase (e.g., leave one out CV; 5-fold CV) (Blagus and Lusa, 2015). The performance is reported as the average across the testing folds. CV enables the researcher to double-check the accuracy of a model on different subsets of data, though the algorithm has not been vetted on a population external to the one used for training. In contrast, external validation involves testing the algorithm performance on a completely different dataset than the training set (Park and Han, 2018). This step is crucial before an algorithm's clinical usefulness can be S.A. Graham, et al. Psychiatry Research 284 (2020) 112732 2 determined. 3. Overview of select studies focused on AI for cognitive decline We did not perform a meta-analysis of all studies related to neuro- cognitive disorders and AI. Instead, our goal was to provide a guide to aid clinicians in understanding the heterogeneity and potential value and limitations of a variety of neurocognitive features for AI applica- tions. Using a broad MEDLINE inquiry with several search terms [(“artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” or “NLP”) AND (“cog- nition” or “cognitive testing)],” we then selected studies to illustrate the diversity of data sources and research questions addressed using AI, preferring those with larger sample sizes and clear explanations of the ML approach. We selected studies that showcased common classes of features used for detecting, classifying, or predicting cognitive status and that em- ployed the most common AI techniques emerging in healthcare: SL, UL, DL, and NLP (Jiang et al., 2017). Six feature categories (i.e., types of datasets) emerged from the studies selected: sociodemographic data, clinical and psychometric assessments; neuroimaging and neurophy- siological data; electronic health record (EHR) and claims data; novel assessments (e.g., handwriting and speech analyzes); and genomic and other omic data. Table 1 showcases different AI techniques used with each feature category, with its strengths and limitations. 3.1. Sociodemographic data (Table 1 section A) Sociodemographic and other forms of population data offer rich information from large datasets (e.g., the US Health and Retirement Study (Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 2019. Health and Retirement Study.); Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-ERIC, 2019); Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (Korean Employment Information Services. 2015. Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging. https://survey.keis.or.kr/eng/klosa/klosa01.jsp)). De Langavant et al. (2018) developed an UL-based algorithm for identifying partici- pants with high likelihood of dementia from population-based surveys, Fig. 1.

Graham, et al. Psychiatry Research 284 (2020) 112732 8 without clinical diagnosis, using both American and European subjects, with the potential to flag individuals within a large population-based sample for cognitive screening. The Na study (Na, 2019) used variables commonly collected in community health care institutions (socio- demographics, health, subjective well-being) and foundage and edu- cation were particularly important in predicting cognitive decline in a community sample of Korean adults. A benefit of such data is that they are often stratified geographically and cover various demographic groups. They are also easy to collect for reasonable cost and can be widely disseminated. Such data can poten- tially help with early risk stratification and subsequent identification of high-risk individuals in need of more detailed assessments (De Langavant et al., 2018). These data may also contain social de- terminants of health (e.g., education), often overlooked in other clinical data. Because many countries collect population data regarding health, socioeconomic status, and social and family networks of older adults, such information may also provide an opportunity to compare out- comes across different countries and infer global health estimates of dementia burden. However, simply identifying putative risk and pro- tective factors for cognitive decline from sociodemographic data may be of limited use for predicting future cognitive impairment for an in- dividual. Furthermore, the findings from one country/setting may not relate directly to participants in other nations, e.g., extrapolating from a Korean sample to a US sample or vice versa. However, when combined with clinical measures like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as shown by Na (2019), sociodemographics could be a useful addition to a ML algorithm. Multi-modal variables are most meaningful when their complex interactions are analyzed comprehensively, and long- itudinally (e.g., (Na, 2019)), using ML models. 3.2. Clinical and psychometric assessments (Table 1 section B) Clinical assessment data offer readily available, inexpensive, and rich sources of information. The three studies highlighted in this cate- gory show how AI techniques can be used to streamline a cognitive assessment battery for dementia (Lins et al., 2017), incorporate in- formation from clinical notes to improve diagnostic accuracy of MCI and dementia (Moreira and Namen, 2018), and best distinguish be- tween normal cognition and MCI using neuropsychological measures (Senanayake et al., 2017). The three studies differ widely in sample size, input data, and algorithms, demonstrating the varied applications of such data. Given that every major healthcare provider collects clin- ical variables, these data promote generalizability of ML algorithms and can potentially involve large samples if every individual in an area or healthcare system is included. Similar to population-based socio- demographics, clinical data may be best for identifying high-risk in- dividuals who need additional assessments and clinical interventions to help focus resources most efficiently. However, clinical assessments are not streamlined or standardized (primary versus subspecialty settings), and different clinicians may use different measures (e.g., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) versus the MMSE). AI may be able to address the limitations of heterogeneous data by using a heterogeneous training set, or by testing models in different populations. ML techni- ques may also help to rank the factors that are critical for assessing cognitive impairment and thus help to focus on these factors. The quality and accuracy of clinical data can be variable and require de- tailed record-keeping and access to the data to be useful for AI. 3.3. Neuroimaging and neurophysiological data (Table 1 section C) Neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques have grown con- siderably in the past decade. Research continues to demonstrate their use for providing important information about the brain's structure and function (Khandai and Aizenstein, 2013). Brain imaging is often used to detect neurological causes (e.g., tumors, stroke), but not psycho- pathology (Vernooij et al., 2019).

S.A. Graham, et al. Psychiatry Research 284 (2020) 112732 9 images, AI techniques can outperform specialists in detecting early or “preclinical” degradation of neuroanatomy because AI is particularly well suited to detecting abnormalities within image and signal data through training (i.e., pattern recognition) (Ahmed et al., 2019; Hosny et al., 2018). AI offers the potential to improve interpretability and clinical utility of neuroimaging and neurophysiological data that are commonly obtained but incompletely understood. We may learn from AI about new aspects of brain function and connectivity and generate new hypotheses regarding brain-based mechanisms of neu- ropsychiatric diseases. The four examples of AI used with brain imaging data show how different EEG (Fan et al., 2018) and brain imaging profiles (Gamberger et al., 2017; Grassi et al., 2018; Iizuka et al., 2019) can be used to identify cognitive impairment (Fan et al., 2018; Iizuka et al., 2019) and predict prognostic trajectories (Gamberger et al., 2017; Grassi et al., 2018) in different populations. Neuroimaging and neurophysiological data are considered high di- mensional data—data where the number of features often greatly ex- ceeds the number of observations. Because most statistical analyzes are better suited for lower dimensional data, ML is an ideal alternative for traditional neuroimaging/neurophysiology analyzes. Given recent in- itiatives to grow open source datasets like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (e.g., (Gamberger et al., 2017)), the “big data” required for optimal AI techniques are also available. Ulti- mately, combining AI techniques with rich biological information contained in neuroimaging will enable faster, safer, cheaper, and more accurate imaging results, usable for informing diagnoses, prognoses, and treatment decisions. However, neuroimaging and neurophysiolo- gical assessments are not commonly offered in all medical settings be- cause of high costs and safety issues like radiation exposure. There is also considerable heterogeneity among datasets regarding imaging modalities (magnetic resononce imaging or MRI versus positron emis- sion tomography or PET), machines (different strengths of MRI ma- chines), and processing approaches which continue to evolve. 3.4. Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data (Table 1 section D) The EHR includes huge amounts of patient-specific information containing both structured (coded) and unstructured (free text) entries (Hayrinen et al., 2008). EHR may also contain some sociodemographic and clinical data mentioned above, depending on the vendor and/or health organization. The four highlighted studies in this section used nationwide administrative claims data (Nori et al., 2019), EHR from a regional Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (a publicly adminis- tered program) (Shao et al., 2019), EHR from a regional not-for-profit academic healthcare system (Wang et al., 2019), and EHR from two hospital-based samples (Wang et al., 2018). These datasets record and help to manage patient care and offer a relatively inexpensive source of information collected over long time periods on large numbers of pa- tients. The large size of these databases (i.e., thousands of individuals) enables studies of rare conditions, and the longitudinal aspect of the data enables researchers to investigate effects of treatment(s) over time. Nori et al., 2019 and Wang et al., 2019 utilized the longitudinal nature of EHR data to find features related to increased incidence of near-term (4-5 years) dementia (Nori et al., 2019) and mortality (Wang et al., 2019). ML algorithms can deal with very large numbers of po- tential input features (e.g., Nori et al., 2019) used over 10,000 clinical, pharmaceutical, and demographic variables) and rapidly develop pre- dictive models without specific selection of variables, enabling auto- mated selection of high value predictors. However, EHR data alone have relatively limited predictive power when analyzed in the absence of other social determinants of health (e.g., population-based socio- demographic data) (Freij et al., 2019). EHR systems are primarily designed for streamlining billing pur- poses; thus, the data for deciphering and supporting clinical decision- making may not always be available. The quality and quantity of EHR data are also dependent on external factors (e.g., severity of illness, insurance rules, regional practices, availability of resources) and are heterogeneous in organization and level of detail. For example, the findings from a regional VA health system (as in Shao et al., 2019) may be more representative of care at other VA health systems, whereas there may be considerable regional differences within other nationwide insurers (e.g., Blue Cross Blue Shield versus Kaiser Permanente) due to different patient populations and plan structures. AI will be particularly useful with these data if it can “learn” the different styles of doc- umentation from different providers and different healthcare systems - a excellent area for NLP applications. Finally, AI could help healthcare providers to better and more efficiently understand their patient's clinical history and guide their decision-making process. Claims data, like those used by Nori et al., 2019, are generated primarily for the administration of payment for health services deliv- ered. These data offer structured information on patient interactions with a healthcare system (e.g., billed services, prescriptions) and has the ability to link records with other large registries (e.g., death records, cancer databases). Unlike EHRs, claims only offer limited information on clinical severity and patients’ health status, without laboratory, imaging, and other diagnostic test results. Furthermore, claims records do not reflect treatments and assessments that were suggested by clinicians and refused by patients. Claims data have the advantage, however, of collecting data from various sites that may not be included in a single EHR and result in a nationally representative sample. They may help to identify and reduce common biases in healthcare, e.g., when combined with other clinical data, they can help determine which conditions were undiagnosed in some patients, and at what point in time, so that future ML algorithms can detect early markers and in- dicators of future disease. Potential disadvantages to claims data in- clude differences in values between billed and paid claims, con- fidentiality issues, and negative consequences like premiums based on personal traits potentially affecting insurability. 3.5. Novel assessments (sensors, handwriting, speech) (Table 1 section E) Novel features like sensor (digital) data, handwriting (text), and speech (audio), offer unique opportunities to identify new indicators of cognitive decline (Kourtis et al., 2019). The five exemplar studies in Table 1 include home-based motion sensors (Akl et al., 2015), com- puterized handwriting analyzes (Angelillo et al., 2019), videotaped handwashing tasks (Ashraf and Taati, 2016), multi-modal wearable activity monitors (Gwak et al., 2018), and audio-recorded speech data (Toth et al., 2018) for detecting cognitive impairment. These data (particularly environmental and wearable sensors) have the potential for continuous, longitudinal tracking of cognitive changes. For example, Akl et al. (2015) installed passive infrared motion sensors in partici- pants’ homes to assess movements and general activity by location that may be indicative of MCI over a 3-year period. They found that novel features like the trajectories of weekly walking speed were among the most important for detecting MCI in older adults. However, current relationships of these novel data with cognitive status are not yet well characterized. Furthermore, the sensor data contain artifacts (visitors, noise) and have considerable heterogeneity across individuals and en- vironments (one- versus two-faucet handles, microphone position). Nonetheless, sensors offer an opportunity for tracking real-world be- haviors in more ecologically valid environments than traditional la- boratory or clinic settings. Longitudinal sensor data are particularly difficult to visualize, understand, and manage without specialized al- gorithms provided by ML. 3.6. Genomic and other omics data (Table 1 section F) Genomic data are probably the best example of the big data ideally suited to ML analytic techniques. DL, in particular, is most useful when large amounts of data are available, and the human genome comprises more than 3 billion base pairs with a multitude of complex processes S.A. Graham, et al. Psychiatry Research 284 (2020) 112732 10 governing the expression of different genes (Libbrecht and Noble, 2017). Despite major advances in genomics, we still do not fully understand the various genes’ functions and how they impact our physiology and health. Gene expression data can be used to learn to distinguish among different disease phenotypes and identify potentially valuable disease biomarkers. Alzheimer's Disease (AD), for example, is partially heritable and genetically complex. Large genome databases can offer enough training data to build accurate prediction models re- lating to gene expression, genomic regulation, or variant interpretation associated with AD and other cognitive impairments. The three studies highlighted in this section include a study of specific genes from a large NIH database (Jamal et al., 2016), gut microbiome analyzes (Haran et al., 2019), and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data integrated with brain imaging (Zhou et al., 2018). The field of genomics is central to the precision medicine movement, as the illnesses an in- dividual may experience are determined to a variable extent by their genes. ML has also enabled direct-to-consumer applications of genomic analyzes like “23andMe” and “Ancestry.com.” ML approaches have been leveraged to annotate a variety of genomic sequence elements (e.g., splice sites, promotors, enhancers), differentiate among different disease phenotypes, identify disease biomarkers, and investigate me- chanisms underlying gene expression. However, genome-wide associa- tion studies (GWAS) for polygenic diseases like AD require extremely large sample sizes, which may limit the depth of phenotypic data and thus reduce the accuracy of these algorithms (e.g., 80% for Jamal et al. (2016); 65% for Zhou et al., 2018). 4. Discussion 4.1. High-dimensional data for AI Different feature types for helping to detect, classify, and predict early pathological cognitive decline in older adults have varied strengths and limitations. The best-performing AI algorithms will re- quire multi-feature data (Jiang et al., 2017) to personalize the findings to the level of the individual patient with their unique bio-psycho-social makeup (Havelka et al., 2009). For example, models based on only EHR data are likely to be biased due to the lack of important information about everyday functioning (e.g., physical function, social connections) that is also critical for health aging (Jeste et al., 2019). Based on this small subsample of studies, a wide variety of features (socio- demographic and clinical factors, specific cognitive tests, functional impairments, mobility problems, speech patterns, electro- encephalogram (EEG) measures, MRI-derived brain structures, PET and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan find- ings, and genes) were found to be associated with or predictive of cognitive impairment. To improve diagnosis and prognosis for adults with cognitive decline, AI research will require large, comprehensive, multi-feature datasets that are collected longitudinally to better predict cognitive trajectories over time (Chi et al., 2017). Developing such datasets entails several inherent challenges. Ongoing efforts to continually curate large-scale datasets like the ADNI and the UK Biobank databases will be key to the clinical success of AI, though they are costly and labor-intensive. Some claims and EHR companies are currently in search of feasible and legal ways to link these data with health risk assessments, sociodemographic data, and vital signs on a broad basis to create a more holistic picture of patients’ health (Freij et al., 2019). Furthermore, large-scale availability of novel features may be limited by proven clinical utility. For example, while neuroimaging or biosensor data can provide rich, multi-feature input for an AI algorithm, such data would not be available without broad insurance coverage and access to laboratory facilities (Crown, 2015). 4.2. Future directions for AI and neurocognitive research AI's strength lies in its ability to accommodate large quantities of multimodal data. Thus, AI can aid better understanding of unique fac- tors and behaviors associated with cognitive decline that have been previously difficult to quantify, e.g., loneliness or social isolation (Biddle et al., 2019; Linggonegoro and Torous, n.d.), resilience and wisdom (Meeks and Jeste, 2009), and behavioral symptoms like agi- tation and psychosocially (Cheng, 2017; Feast et al., 2016). Capturing these factors and behaviors will require leveraging technology and novel inputs like mobile devices and sensor signals that are continually increasing in popularity and place low burden on the healthcare system (Kourtis et al., 2019). The temptation may be to include the “kitchen sink” when devel- oping a ML model because these algorithms enable a much larger set of predictor variables than commonly used in clinical research. However, features should still be evaluated for their validity in terms of potential relationships to the outcome of interest. It is also possible to create increasingly precise algorithms with additional features or continually fine-tuning the ML algorithm – though this may raise the likelihood of overfitting the model such that the algorithm is too customized for the particular training data and would not transfer well to another sample (Park and Han, 2018). ML methods are subject to the same challenges and sources of bias encountered in observational data analyzes using traditional statistical approaches. While small and labeled datasets for specific tasks are ea- sier to collect, the resultant algorithms may not transfer to other da- tasets. In contrast, large and unlabeled datasets are also fairly easy to collect, but require a shift toward semi-supervised or unsupervised learning techniques that are harder to train (Esteva et al., 2019). Im- plementation of standards for AI/ML studies will be key to ensuring study quality. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently released a white paper (US Food and Drug Administration, 2019) so- liciting advice (by June 3rd, 2019) from stakeholders to help developers bring AI devices to market. The considerations discussed therein pertain to transparency, interpretability, and replication as components of “good ML practices”. The World Economic Forum has also re- commended a governance structure, safety and efficacy regulations, and responsible practices in the development of technological tools (World Economic Forum). Governmental regulation may be essential to establish regulatory guidelines for AI applications in research like those endorsed by the EQUATOR network (Equator Network. 2019. Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research). The Computing Community Consortium also recently published a 20-year community roadmap for AI research (Gil and Selman, 2019), citing integrated intelligence (e.g., creating open-shared repositories of ma- chine-understandable world knowledge); meaningful interaction (e.g., techniques for productive collaboration in mixed teams of humans and machines); and self-aware learning (e.g., developing causal and steer- able models from numerical data and observations) as research prio- rities to realize societal benefits. All of the studies presented in this overview focused on diagnosis or prediction of a neurocognitive disease. Algorithms to detect neuro- cognitive impairments may be able to support the decision-making capabilities of an experienced clinician, but they will not replace clin- ical expertise. No studies to date have directly compared clinical di- agnostic accuracy of a neurocognitive disorder head-to-head with an AI approach, so the efficacy of these algorithms remains to be determined, with a few exceptions (Brinker et al., 2019; Lindsey et al., 2018; Nam et al., 2019). An accurate prediction of a patient diagnosis also does not provide clinicians with direction to change that outcome. However, AI could potentially expedite patient diagnoses if it can flag patients that are in need of immediate care or follow-up (Savage, 2019). If AI could further supplement clinical knowledge with less common datastreams, it may lend considerable support to individualizing prognoses and treatment decisions. Clinicians will require background knowledge regarding AI to decipher results and gauge the utility of such information (for an excellent guide applied to radiology, see (Park and Han, 2018)). Collaboration between clinicians and AI experts will be S.A. Graham, et al. Psychiatry Research 284 (2020) 112732 11 key to continual development of AI models, as clinicians can share their deep understanding of clinical populations – and the heterogeneity among individuals and over time – that will aid AI researchers in re- fining AI algorithms and transferring them to other populations. 4.3. Ethics of using AI for neurocognitive disorders The ethical and social implications of using AI for detection and prediction of neurocognitive disorders include the need to weigh ben- efits against potential risks to patients. The benefits could be better healthcare; however, it is important to consider bias and accountability (Challen et al., 2019). For example, a risk may stem from whether the algorithm was built upon data that are not representative of the patient in question (e.g., older adults from underrepresented minorities), and subsequently presents a diagnosis that is questionable. Moving forward, there will need to be procedures to account for, and take action to mitigate, potential bias to avoid exacerbating inequities. AI models must be deployed in diverse samples to ensure generalizability. More- over, how a decision is derived by the algorithm needs to be transparent to the clinician (Samek et al., 2017) so that a questionable re- commendation can be examined before action is taken. Within the context of diagnosing and predicting the trajectory of dementia, there are many disease-specific concerns. Once an individual is diagnosed with dementia, there can be serious legal and financial consequences, including the ability to make decisions, live in- dependently, and even drive motor vehicles (Cornett and Hall, 2008). Algorithms can increasingly be applied to smartphones and other pro- ducts that are widely distributed, based on inputs such as keyboard typing patterns (White et al., 2018). While highly scalable, data own- ership and privacy issues are a concern especially since regulations to protect user privacy are lacking, which may expose more people to surreptitious cognitive health surveillance. For example, passive sur- veillance tools applied to smartphone usage or social media posts could negatively impact ones job security, driving license, and insurance premiums (Rosenfeld and Torous, 2017). With such high stakes, the medical community must follow evidence-based practices to diagnose and treat their patients and pharmacotherapies must undergo rigorous clinical trials prior to approval by the FDA. Similarly, AI-derived al- gorithms must meet clinical standards. However, the threshold of proof and utility of AI models is not yet established. Adopting AI algorithms in clinical practice carries the additional challenge of establishing trust in the model. The “black box” of ML presents a unique problem in how we reconcile the AI model's results with our clinical experience and the scientific literature. The movement to develop Explainable AI (XAI) may aid the ability of clinicians to communicate these findings with other clinicians as well as with pa- tients and their families to guide clinical decision-making (Gunning, 2017). XAI involves efforts to address a machine's ability to explain its decisions and actions to users. The goal is explainable models that still have a high level of performance. Ultimately, health- care liability remains with the clinician; thus, AI tools need to best support clinicians. 4.4. Limitations of this review Caution is necessary when generalizing the results of the studies presented in this paper, as they are not exhaustive, and therefore, not representative of the entire body of literature on AI and neurocognitive disorders. Due to the use of multiple definitions of MCI, the a priori labeling of MCI versus dementia groups may not reflect the longitudinal outcomes. There are potentially more recent exemplar studies within these feature categories that we did not capture. We also have not summarized these studies in any quantitative manner, as our goal was to highlight the breadth and range of studies that use AI methods to examine features of datasets relevant to neurocognitive disorders. This research is in too early a stage and consists of too much heterogeneity in methods to enable meaningful systematic analysis. 5. Conclusion AI technology holds remarkable promise for transforming the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders. There exist a large variety of potential features that in combination can comprehensively characterize the bio-psycho-social determinants of a unique individual and thus enable more personalized understanding of cognitive decline. The performance and potential clinical utility of ML algorithms for detecting, diagnosing, and predicting cognitive decline using these features will continue to improve as we leverage multi- feature datasets on large datasets. Establishing guidelines for research involving AI applications in healthcare will be necessary to ensure the quality of results, as will engagement of clinicians (as well as patients and their caregivers) so that they may contribute their expertise in the refinement of AI algorithms. With the assistance of AI, early detection of cognitive decline may not be as difficult as it is today. Declaration of Competing Interest Authors YY and HK are employees of IBM.

The aim of this review is to guide the development of private and ef-ficient ML models in healthcare, with the prospects of translating research effortsinto real-world settings.1 INTRODUCTIONMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have shown great promise in many domains, lever-aging the use of large datasets. Some notable contributions include AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021)for the prediction of protein structures and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) for natural languageprocessing. Healthcare is one of the domains in which ML is expected to provide substantial im-provements in the delivery of patient care worldwide (WHO, 2021). Given the rapid growth in thenumber of models over the last couple of years (Ravı̀ et al., 2016; Miotto et al., 2018; Kaul et al.,2022; Javaid et al., 2022), healthcare applications deserve special consideration considering the sen-sitive nature of the data that is required to train the models and the safety-critical nature of medicaldecision-making.In this regard, real-world implementation of such models is still hampered by ethical and legal con-straints. Legal frameworks have been developed and enforced to guarantee the transparency andprivacy of ML-based healthcare solutions, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Account-ability Act (HIPAA) in the United States (Gostin et al., 2009) and the General Data Protection Reg-ulation (GDPR) in Europe (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). Therefore, there is a crucial need forPrivacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) in healthcare to enable the implementation of trust-worthy systems in the future. The main goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overviewof state-of-the-art PPML in healthcare and encourage the development of new methodologies thattackle specific challenges relevant to the nature of the domain.Motivation. There exist several related literature reviews that focus on a specific subset of PPML forhealthcare. Several highlight recent advancements in federated learning (Xu et al., 2021; Ali et al.,2022; Joshi et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022), cryptographic techniques (Zalonis et al., 2022), or se-curity aspects of ML models, such as adversarial attacks (Liu et al., 2021). Existing review articlescover a wide range of applications related to health and input data modalities, ranging from IoTsensors to medical images (Qayyum et al., 2020). Compared to existing work, our review has threemain contributions with the intent of bridging between research pertaining to ML for healthcare andcybersecurity. First, we distinguish between PPML for training and inference, i.e., ML-as-a-service.∗Equal contributions.1ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for HealthcareSecond, we focus on state-of-the-art (SOTA) literature published in the last three years, consideringthe high proliferation of ML in healthcare and recent methodological advancements in ML and DL(e.g., network architectures, model pre-training, etc.). Third, we consider studies that develop orapply methodologies using two popular modalities based on publicly available datasets and state-of-the-art in ML for healthcare, namely medical images and data extracted from Electronic HealthRecords (EHR) (Kaul et al., 2022).Despite the use of other input modalities in medical applications,such as video (Ouyang et al., 2020) or text (Srivastava et al., 2019), our review exclusively focuseson medical images and EHR as they are the most prevalent input modalities in diagnostic and prog-nostic settings (Shehab et al., 2022). Lastly, although we acknowledge the importance of securityfor ML models, it is out of the scope of this paper since we primarily focus on privacy.To this end, we review papers that meet the following inclusion criteria:1. We include recently published work i.e., publication year ≥ 2020.2. We include articles that focus on the application or development of PPML either for modeltraining and/or inference, including but not restricted to homomorphic encryption, differ-ential privacy, federated learning, and multi-party secure computation.3. We include articles that consider clinical tasks involving medical images and/or EHR data.In Section 2, we provide background knowledge about concepts and terminology concerning PPML.In Section 3, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art pertaining to PPML for training (Section3.1) and for inference (Section 3.2). Later in Section 4, we discuss open challenges and derive futuredirections. Finally, we provide concluding remarks in Section 5.2 PRIVACY-PRESERVING MACHINE LEARNING: BACKGROUND &TERMINOLOGY2.1 FEDERATED LEARNINGSince medical data is highly sensitive, data sharing is difficult, and subject to ethical restrictions andlegal constraints if at all possible. Federated learning (FL) (McMahan et al., 2017) aims to overcomethe challenges of data sharing by enabling collaborative training, which does not require that theinvolved parties share their training data. Therefore, the data remains private to each local nodewithin the FL network, such that only the model updates are shared and integrated in a centralizedmodel.Federated averaging (McMahan et al., 2017) is the most common form of FL. In this setting, acentralized server is connected to N entities, which have their own training data. The central serverorchestrates the collaborative training process as follows: (1) the initial model is distributed amongstall entities, (2) each entity performs a training iteration on their local model using their own trainingdata, typically one epoch, and shares its resulting model parameters with the central server, (3) theserver averages the model parameters shared by all entities and distributes the resulting (averaged)model amongst all entities, and (4) steps (2) and (3) are repeated sequentially until a performancethreshold or a specific number of training iterations is achieved. FL has proven to be very efficient intraining models with strong performance, while avoiding the need for data sharing (McMahan et al.,2017). However, FL might be vulnerable to privacy issues such as reconstruction attacks (Liu et al.,2022), thus requiring that it is combined with other privacy-preserving methods to ensure robustprivacy guarantees (Nguyen et al., 2022).2.2 DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACYDifferential Privacy (DP) has its origins in statistical analysis of databases. Its main aim is to addressthe paradox of learning nothing about specific individuals, while learning useful information aboutthe general population (Dwork et al., 2014). In the FL context, it is usually incorporated in the formof additive noise to model updates, either artificially or using a differentiable private optimizer, priorto transferring the updates from the entities to the central server (Abadi et al., 2016). The amount ofartificial noise added is directly proportional to the degree of privacy desired (i.e., privacy budget)(Zhang et al., 2021c). DP can successfully make privacy attacks fail, such as reconstruction attacks,2ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcareas the added noise hinders the inference of actual knowledge about the training data by the attacker.However, adding too much noise (i.e., high privacy budget) can hamper learning and negativelyimpact the model accuracy (Chilukoti et al., 2022).2.3 HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTIONIn mathematics, the term homomorphic refers to the transformation of a given set into another whilepreserving the relation between the elements in both sets. Thus, Homomorphic Encryption (HE)refers to the conversion of plaintext into ciphertext while preserving the structure of the data. Con-sequently, specific operations applied to the ciphertext will provide the same results as if they wereapplied to the plaintext but without compromising the encryption (Acar et al., 2018). That is, theplaintext data is never accessed nor decrypted as the operations are directly applied to the encrypteddata. The result of the transformations on the ciphertext can only be decrypted back to plaintext bythe encryption key owner.Despite the benefit of provable privacy guarantees, the range of operations available in HE is re-stricted to addition and multiplication i.e., fully homomorphic encryption. This limits the setand number of transformations applicable to the data and requires the use of approximations formore complex operations (e.g., HE-ReLU is the polynomial approximation of the ReLU function(Yue et al., 2021b)). This also significantly increases the computational time needed to process en-crypted text compared to plaintext by several orders of magnitude (Popescu et al., 2021).2.4 SECURE MULTI-PARTY COMPUTATIONSecure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) (Goldreich, 1998) provides a framework in which two ormore parties jointly compute a public function with their data while keeping the inputs private andhidden from other parties using cryptographic protocols. Most protocols used for SMPC with morethan two parties are based on Secret Sharing (SS). In SS, a portion of the secret input is shared amonga number of other parties. Most ML methods use Shamir’s SS and additive SS (Singh & Shukla,2021b). Although these methods are considered information-theoretic secure cryptosystems, recentstudies show that leakage of global data properties can occur in some scenarios (Zhang et al., 2021a).While both FL and SMPC rely on collaborative training via knowledge sharing and keep the end-point data private, their implementation differs significantly. SMPC involves cryptography and canbe used for training and inference, whereas FL does not involve cryptography nor provides strongprivacy guarantees, and is only used for model training.3 OVERVIEW OF STATE-OF-THE-ARTFollowing the inclusion criteria described in Section 1, we summarize existing work on PPMLfor healthcare based on whether the work focuses on model training (Table 1) or model inference(Table 2). For each study (row) we describe several attributes. Use case provides a succinct summaryof the objective of the study. Model reports the ML or DL architecture that was employed to modelthe task. Medical datasets summarizes the datasets that were used for model training and evaluation.Additionally, we use the * symbol to indicate the use of a private dataset. ML task describes thenature of the prediction task (e.g., binary or multi-class classification). Input modality reports thenature of the model’s input data, which could either be I for medical images or E for EHR data.In the Validation column, we report whether the trained model was internally and/or externallyevaluated, with Ëindicating the use of internal validation i.e., test set from the same distributionof the training data, and ËËindicating the assessment of the generalization of the model on anexternal test dataset. Lastly, Metrics lists the evaluation metrics used to describe the performance ofthe proposed model.3.1 PRIVACY-PRESERVING TRAINING FOR HEALTHCAREAs observed in Table 1, the most commonly used privacy-preserving approach for model trainingis FL, either independently or in combination with DP. DP is added to increase the privacy of theFL training updates i.e., adding noise to the shared weights, thus making the system more robust to3ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for HealthcareTable 1: Summary of PPML in healthcare for model training. We summarize studies that focus on de-veloping PPML in the context of model training.

However, as describedin the previous section, training ML models on encrypted data significantly increases the computa-tional complexity and the processing overhead by several orders of magnitude (Wibawa et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2022). It also adds noise to the training process due to the approximations of activationfunctions, especially in large models.The third most common approach is standalone DP, which is less computationally demanding andprovides strong privacy guarantees. However, the increase in privacy guarantees is negatively cor-related with model accuracy, as it is associated with an increase in the quantity of noise applied.Therefore, the trade-off between privacy (i.e., privacy budget) and model accuracy is a relevantfactor to take into account for the inclusion of DP in any ML solution.

Although some studies train their models on several datasets, including popularcomputer vision benchmarks, the vast majority restrict their evaluation to one input modality fromthe same dataset.This limits the generalization of the results and neglects the potential improvement in predictiveperformance that could result from combining different data sources in multi-modal learning set-tings (Ramachandram & Taylor, 2017). Furthermore, most studies perform internal validation, suchthat the test sets are from the same distribution as the training dataset. This is generally a com-mon challenge in healthcare applications considering distribution shifts across different hospitals,for example due to differences in patient demographics. Finally, most existing work focuses onconvolutional neural networks to handle computer vision tasks. However, validation schemes andmetrics reported are not consistent, making the comparison among them very difficult. Due to thesereasons and the lack of medical benchmark datasets, a fair comparison of the approaches is difficult,and therefore we do not assess performance metrics results in this review and defer it to future work.3.2 PRIVACY-PRESERVING INFERENCE FOR HEALTHCAREWe now focus on the literature employing PPML methods for inference, as summarized in Ta-ble 2. We frame PPML for inference as providing private machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS)or inference-as-a-service (IaaS) (Lins et al., 2021). In this scenario, a model with strong perfor-mance is controlled by a single party (i.e., model owner), and other external parties (i.e., clients)would like the model to perform inference on their own data. The external parties can share datasamples with the model owner and their predictions are sent back. Due to legal and/or ethical con-5ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for HealthcareTable 2: Summary of PPML in healthcare for model inference. We summarize studies that focus ondeveloping PPML in the context of model inference. We group them based on the methodology considered, i.e.homomorphic encryption, combination of federated learning and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC),differential privacy and SMPC, federated learning with blockchain and SMPC, and finally federated learningwith differential privacy and homomorphic encryption.Reference Use case ModelMedicaldataset/sML taskInputmodalityValidation MetricsHOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTIONYue et al.

(2020).straints related to privacy, clients cannot disclose their data with the model owner, thus requiring theuse of PPML to maintain the privacy of the data they wish to share.Compared to the number of studies addressing PPML for training, a relatively fewer number haveexplored PPML for inference. Most studies within the theme of PPML for inference, focus onthe deployment of the trained model as a service and its use by third parties. The most commonapproach for delivering PPML IaaS is HE, which ensures with provable mathematical guaranteesthat neither the model owner nor any intermediate party are able to inspect the original data northe detection result i.e., both are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the data owner. Anothercommon approach is SMPC, which also leverages encryption schemes, being used in combinationwith other privacy-preserving collaborative approaches such as FL, DP and blockchain.Similar to PPML for training, most studies here use a single source of input data (i.e., images inmost cases), neglecting many other diverse medical modalities of varying characteristics. The lackof use of benchmark medical datasets and inconsistent validation schemes and metrics hinders thegeneralization of the proposed approaches.3.3 OPEN CHALLENGESThere is no one-size-fits-all PPML approach for model training or inference by design. Weobserve that previous work pick and choose PPML approaches based on the intended clinical usecase. Currently, there is no consensus on what different “privacy models” look like in healthcare.Since the methodology depends on the use case, we also observe a clear trade-off between privacyand accuracy, based on the availability of computational resources. For instance, standalone FL iscomputationally faster than HE, but it does not provide strong privacy guarantees. On the other hand,HE and DP can provide strong privacy guarantees but they add noise to the model both for privatetraining and private inference resulting in less accurate solutions. For HE, this is especially critical6ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcarefor model training where successive layers of approximations are needed to perform operations thatare not supported, such as softmax, or that are computationally inefficient, such as max pooling.In general, encryption-based options are provably secure but computationally inefficient, since theyincrease the processing overhead of training using cyphertext compared to plaintext data.Additionally, the availability of computational resources is a decisive factor in choosing a partic-ular PPML methodology. For instance, in the HE scenario, sending data over a communicationchannel does not require infrastructure for model training but still requires handling the encryp-tion/decryption process appropriately. In the FL context, it requires that the entity has allocatedresources for model training.The centralization of model training in FL poses an additional security threat. Relying on asingle central server entails a single point of failure that is highly susceptible to security attacks suchas Denial-of-Service. Although blockchain has been proposed to achieve fully distributed trainingand mitigate this threat, it increases the complexity of the information technology infrastructuresignificantly, requiring dedicated resources for the implementation of the distributed ledger andmodeling framework.Most existing work use a single dataset and do not conduct external validation, thus aris-ing concerns about the generalization of the results. We observe that existing work focus ona limited set of medical datasets. Additionally, some work only evaluate their solutions on com-puter vision benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) inferring that good performance onthese datasets will provide similar results on medical image data (Festag & Spreckelsen, 2020;Onesimu & Karthikeyan, 2020). However, this assumption is not empirically supported by workthat uses both medical and non-medical datasets (Suriyakumar et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021b;Gopalakrishnan et al., 2021; Jarin & Eshete, 2021; Vizitiu et al., 2020) and must, therefore, beavoided.MLaaS for healthcare has not been explored thoroughly. As demonstrated by the limited lit-erature on this topic, we observe that the literature is highly skewed towards PPML for training.Considering disparities in technical capabilities and expertise, information technology resources,and availability of data across medical institutions, the case in which an entity does not have enoughresources to perform model training independently is highly likely. Thus, the usage of third-partymodels as inference systems that can run on proprietary data is a prominent scenario that has notbeen thoroughly explored and should be considered in future research. MLaaS can provide accessto models with strong performance, enabling full preservation of data privacy using PPML methods.This makes it a more efficient solution for small-scale or low-resource medical entities to access andleverage third-party knowledge.4 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS4.1 COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION ON DIVERSE MEDICAL DATASETSFor the sake of comparison and generalization of results, studies should complement their internaldataset evaluation with additional extensive evaluation on benchmark medical datasets. This is dueto the fact that most of the existing work use a single dataset and do not perform external validation.The number of studies that use external datasets for validation is marginal. Only 9 out of the 40studies considered validated their results with an independent test set. This hampers model general-ization and hinders performance comparison among approaches built for the same medical task. Forbenchmarking, we suggest MedMNIST (Yang et al., 2023), which contains curated datasets for dif-ferent medical tasks and modalities. Therefore, similar to MNIST or CIFAR-10 for computer visionmodels, this medical dataset could be employed as a common benchmark for medical applications.4.2 MULTI-MODAL MODELSCurrent advances in ML for healthcare are moving towards multi-modal learning, where severalsources of information are combined to improve performance (Ramachandram & Taylor, 2017;Soenksen et al., 2022). This approach not only tends to provide better performance but also en-sures a comprehensive understanding of the different physiological variables involved in studyingand modeling the development of human biology and pathology. As observed in Sections 3.1 and7ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for Healthcare3.2, most work is restricted to a single modality. To develop robust and strong ML models, the useof different data sources to develop multi-modal systems is paramount. Notwithstanding that, theuse of more clinical data entails more privacy concerns (e.g., individuals may be identified usingcorrelated data) and requires more training resources due to increased model complexity. There-fore, additional privacy and computational constraints must be considered in the design of thesealgorithms.4.3 MACHINE LEARNING AS A SERVICE (MLAAS)The deployment of PPML within MLaaS is a very promising opportunity to access strong proprietarymodels by less resourceful institutions. Indeed, one of the main objectives of ML in healthcare isto develop efficient and scalable solutions that improve healthcare delivery. In addition to lackof resources, the deployment of these systems in medical settings can also be highly challenging(Kreuzberger et al., 2022; Wiesenfeld et al., 2022). The development of MLaaS is significantly lessinvestigated than PPML for model training. Therefore, further research on this topic is requiredto provide secure, private and efficient data sharing between third-party model providers and clientinstitutions. Reducing obstacles for clinical institutions to access powerful inference systems couldlead to a major improvement in healthcare delivery across regions, bypassing physical barriers. Itcan also lead to an increase in the confidence and widespread adoption of ML in healthcare. It isimportant to note that the success of MLaaS is dependent on improvements in model generalizabilityand fairness in external datasets.4.4 INTEGRATION OF SOTA AND ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNINGFuture work should also investigate the integration of recent advances in DL and ML models inhealthcare, considering that most of the current PPML work focuses on convolutional neural net-works. For instance, the Transformer architecture and its variants (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), whichare considered the current SOTA for many computer vision or natural language processing tasks, areonly adopted by Park et al. (2021), Yang et al. (2022), and Yan et al. (2023) in the current relatedliterature. Adopting SOTA architectures can take advantage of the latest advances in research, bothin terms of optimizing hardware and software, to maintain performance improvements in clinicalprediction tasks.4.5 GLOBAL AND LOCAL EXPLAINABILITYTransparency and model explainability are essential for trustworthy artificial intelligence (OECD,2023b). However, PPML methods, such as data encryption or noise addition, hinder global modeland local prediction explainability. The collision between two key principles for trustworthy ar-tificial intelligence, secure and PPML (OECD, 2023a) and explainability, highlights an importantresearch problem that is currently under-investigated. Only Montenegro et al. (2021) attempt toaddress this problem, which should encourage future work in this research direction.5 CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we introduce and summarize recent literature concerning PPML for model training andinference in the healthcare domain. We highlight trends, challenges and promising future researchdirections. In conclusion, we recognize the lack of consensus when it comes to defining the require-ments of privacy-preserving frameworks in healthcare. This requires collaboration between machinelearning scientists, healthcare practitioners, and privacy and security experts. From the perspectiveof advancing ML approaches, we encourage researchers to perform comprehensive evaluation ofproposed algorithms on diverse medical datasets to increase generalization, to investigate the con-straints of PPML in multi-modal learning settings, to further consider the promise of MLaaS inhealthcare as a catalyst for improved healthcare delivery, and to adopt state-of-the-art advances indeep learning architectures to enhance model performance. Our suggestions aim to address researchgaps and guide future research in PPML to facilitate the future adoption of trustworthy and privateML for healthcare.8ICLR 2023 Workshop on Trustworthy Machine Learning for HealthcareREFERENCESMartin Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H Brendan McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, andLi Zhang.

The background section discusses the basics of machine learning techniques and algorithms, and the increasing interest in their utilization in the healthcare sector. The paper then reviews and critically analyzes four studies that highlight concerns related to using ML in healthcare, including issues of bias, privacy, accountability, and transparency. Based on the analysis of these studies, the paper presents several recommendations for addressing these concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential benefits of using machine learning technology in healthcare. Ultimately, the purpose of this thesis paper is to show that while the ethical concerns around machine in healthcare are significant, they should not deter the development and adoption of such solutions in the sector, but rather inform their design and implementation to maximize their potential benefits while minimizing their risks and harm. 5 1. Introduction The use of machine learning algorithms in healthcare has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize various aspects of medical practice. Machine learning techniques, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), are being increasingly applied to vast amounts of healthcare data, including electronic health records, medical images, genetic data, and wearable sensor data, among others. These algorithms have shown promise in areas such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, personalized medicine, predictive analytics, and more. However, there are many challenges and limitations associated with the use of machine learning models in healthcare. In this paper, I will focus on the ethical concerns posed by the adoption of machine learning algorithms in the healthcare industry. To fully grasp these concerns from the healthcare standpoint, it is important to have a solid understanding of the machine learning component as well. Therefore, I will begin by explaining the technical aspects of machine learning in healthcare, and provide a background of types of data, machine learning techniques, and specific algorithms that are being developed for use in healthcare. I will then review four papers that describe the ethical implications of machine learning across four categories - social justice, electronic health records, algorithm fairness solutions, and intelligent autonomous care provider (IACP) use in behavioral and mental healthcare. Following this review, I will offer a comprehensive list of suggested recommendations that I found through analyzing these papers. Finally, I will conclude by sharing benefits and opportunities related to using machine learning models in the healthcare industry. 6 2. Background In this section of the literature survey paper, I will explain types of data commonly used in machine learning algorithms, as well as various machine learning techniques that use this data. I will then describe machine learning algorithms that are specific to the application of machine learning in the healthcare industry. 2.1 Types of Data Before understanding the algorithms, it is important to understand the types of data available for these algorithms to use [1]. Data can be split into four categories - structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and metadata. Structured data follows a specific structure and order and is very organized and accessible by whoever wishes to use it, and usually stored in a relational database. Examples of structured data include names, addresses, and credit card numbers. Unstructured data, on the other hand, do not follow any order, and this data is much more difficult to analyze than structured data. Examples of unstructured data include blog entries, images, and emails. Semi-structured data borrow components from both unstructured and structured data. This data is not stored in a database as structured data is, but are more organized than unstructured data. Some examples of semi-structured data include HTML files and NoSQL databases. The final data category is metadata, which is different from any of the other categories. Metadata describes the information related to data being used, such as the author’s name, the file size, document keywords, etc. Figure 1 below provides a quick overview of the different types of data mentioned above. 7 Figure 1. Types of data. 2.2 Machine Learning Techniques After the data have been collected, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze the data and provide useful insights. Machine learning techniques can be divided into four distinct categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning [2]. Supervised learning involves training a model on pre-labeled data to make predictions about new data [2]. The model is fed sample input/output pairs and must learn to map new inputs to their correct outputs from the sample data. For supervised learning models, datasets are split into training and testing sets, and the model is evaluated using performance metrics. An example of a supervised learning algorithm would be text classification. On the other hand, unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data to discover patterns and group similar data. Because the data are unlabeled, unsupervised learning algorithms do not have a way to evaluate model performance. Instead, unsupervised learning tasks include density estimation, dimensionality reduction, and other data-driven processes. Structured Data • Follows a rigid structure • Easy access • Example: Address data Unstructured Data • No order • Difficult to analyze • Example: Email file Semi-structured Data • Not stored in a database • Follows a structure • Example: HTML file Metadata • Describes relevant data • Example: Keywords of this paper 8 Then there is semi-supervised learning, which is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning where both labeled and unlabeled data are used [2]. Semi-supervised learning is the ideal machine learning technique when unlabeled data is more available than labeled data, but both exist. In this case, model performance can often be improved by using the two together. This learning technique is commonly used for outlier detection and is commonly used for trying to achieve a prediction outcome that would be more accurate than just using the limited available labeled data. Credit card fraud detection is an example of semi-supervised learning. Finally, reinforcement learning involves developing a model that iteratively learns from environmental feedback and uses this learning to self-improve its performance [2]. Reinforcement learning is based on a reward/penalty model, where the goal is to increase reward or minimize risk. One of the benefits of reinforcement learning is that it does not require human interference or assistance, and some example applications are robotics and autonomous driving. 2.3 Relevant Algorithms Some of the algorithms used most often in healthcare are classification analyses, which is a supervised learning predictive modeling technique. Under the broad term of classification, the most popular algorithms in the healthcare industry are binary classification, naive Bayes, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. In this section, I will briefly describe each of these algorithms. Binary classification tasks have two labels, usually similar “true” and “false” or “yes” and ""no"" [3]. One of the labels is the normal state, and the other is the abnormal state. The binary classification algorithm receives a dataset and can label the data as either the normal state or 9 abnormal state. Naive Bayes is an algorithm based on the Bayes’ theorem of probability that assumes feature independence. One of the benefits of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small training set, but this and the assumption of independence may affect performance. The logistic regression model is another probabilistic model, but rather than being based on a theorem like naive Bayes, the logistic regression model uses a logistic function (sigmoid function) for probabilistic estimation. There are many advantages to using the logistic regression model, such as its ability to overfit high-dimensional data, but the main fault is that it assumes independent-dependent variable linearity. Additionally, though the name might suggest otherwise, logistic regression models are more often used for classification problems than regression problems. The next algorithm, K-nearest neighbors or KNN, is often called a “lazy learning” algorithm [3]. Rather than creating a model using its data, the KNN algorithm classifies the test set using a given similarity measure. The training data points are stored in n-dimensional space, and the proximity to k-nearest neighbors of each point is measured through a majority vote. While this method is relatively unaffected by noisy data, the one drawback is that there is no pre-defined optimal number of nearest neighbors to use, so this must be chosen by the person running the algorithm, which can be tricky. Support vector machines are a versatile model that depend on hyper-planes. They aim to find the best hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes that can separate input data into different classes. These are useful because they have high accuracy and can handle high-dimensional data but are computationally expensive and do not perform well with noisy data. Decision trees and random forests go hand in hand. Decision trees separate input data into smaller subsections based on similarity of features. An example of a decision tree structure can be seen below. Random forests extend the decision tree algorithm by creating an aggregate of many decision trees to achieve a better predictive accuracy than just one single 10 decision tree. The algorithm does this by either averaging the decision trees or using majority voting. Random forest models can improve decision tree accuracy by minimizing the overfitting that is common with decision trees. 3 Machine Learning Solutions in Healthcare Healthcare is a complex field with vast amounts of data generated from various sources, including electronic health records, medical imaging, genetic data, wearable devices, and health sensors, among others. The rapid advancement of technology has led to the availability of big data in healthcare, which presents both opportunities and challenges for improving health care delivery. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a promising approach to harnessing the potential of big data in healthcare. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to analyze and extract insights from large healthcare datasets, with the goal of improving patient outcomes, optimizing clinical decision-making, and enhancing healthcare delivery. As machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence gain traction in several fields, healthcare is an area that has seen rapid growth in using machine learning to solve various issues. These range from data irregularity detection, disease progression prediction, diagnostic assistance, patient data management, and more. In fact, with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic over the past three years, machine learning techniques have grown even more prevalent to aid physicians in the management of the new disease. Some of the ways in which ML has been used during the Covid-19 pandemic are for high-risk patient classification, outbreak timing prediction, outbreak location prediction, and for diagnostic and treatment recommendations. In the graphs below, I track the progress of machine learning and healthcare, 11 as well as the growth during the Covid-19 pandemic specifically, through a keyword search in the PubMed database. Figure 2. Charting the growth of AI/ML keyword searches related to general healthcare [4]. Figure 3. Charting the growth of AI/ML keyword searches related to the Covid-19 pandemic [5]. 12 As seen from these figures, interest in machine learning as applied to healthcare has grown significantly in recent years, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic in the last three years, showing a real area for research and development. 3.1 Ethical Machine Learning in Healthcare The review paper “Ethical Machine Learning in Healthcare” by Irene Y Chen, Emma Pierson, Sherri Rose, Shalmali Josh, Kadija Ferryman, and Marzyeh Ghassemi describes the ethical concerns related to social justice in healthcare machine learning [6]. In addition to describing the implications, the authors highlight current attempts to resolve these issues, as well as their recommendations to the issues. The paper draws upon a large body of literature to conduct the review. 3.1.1 Model Pipeline The authors begin by outlining the model development pipeline for healthcare machine learning. In this section, they study the case of death during childbirth of Black women. The inequality studied here is that Black mothers die at a rate of three times that of white mothers, due to a history of unequal reproductive rights of Black women. The pipeline is organized as follows: Figure 4. Machine Learning Model Development Pipeline. 13 Problem Selection: Biases during problem selection can occur if the algorithmic problem pertains to an understudied area, or one that requires diversity of thinking, which is lacking in the industry today. For example, one of the reasons that this ethical inequality occurs in the problem of maternal death during childbirth is because this issue does not receive as much research attention as it should. Data Collection: When dealing with healthcare data, there can be many discrepancies - in this case, many Black women go into labor at predominantly black serving hospitals, but these also have a higher rate of complications during childbirth. Outcome Definition: After data collection, there are still many ways in which bias can make its way into algorithmic development, such as knowledge bias, healthcare system disparities, social differences, etc. In this problem, simply looking at maternal childbirth deaths would not be helpful when dealing with the mortality rate of Black mothers specifically. Algorithm Development: Models cannot always account for non-technological biases, such as social or income bias, which is very prevalent when dealing with issues of racial minority communities. Post-deployment Considerations: after the algorithm is trained and released, considerations about biased predictions may not be considered in clinical healthcare settings. For example, in maternal childbirth deaths in black communities, algorithms may make recommendations without understanding that these policies could end up disadvantaging Black women because they do not pertain specifically to that community. 3.1.2 Ethical Challenges in Pipeline Stages 14 After outlining the pipeline, the authors then delve into the relevant ethical dilemmas common for each stage of the model pipeline. In this section, I will summarize these stages as described in the paper. 3.1.2.1 Problem Selection The authors specify four specific areas that cause ethical issues in healthcare machine learning problem selection - global health injustice, racial injustice, gender injustice, and diversity of the scientific workforce. While this section is not directly related to algorithms or development, it is important to understand underlying healthcare biases when learning about the ethical implications of machine learning in the healthcare industry. Global Health Injustice: This ethical dilemma deals with the fact that there is a great funding disparity in healthcare, and most poverty-stricken countries receive a miniscule amount of funding for their diseases. Racial Injustice: Racial Bias is a very common ethical issue in healthcare, as diseases that affect white populations on a larger scale, like cystic fibrosis, receive much more funding than those that affect other populations, such as sickle cell diseases. Gender Injustice: Women’s health often receives far less time, attention, and money than illnesses and conditions that affect men. For example, menstrual issues and endometriosis are often stigmatized and people do not have basic knowledge on these issues → this sentiment carries into clinical medicine and women’s menstrual health is extremely understudied. Diversity of the Scientific Workforce: Because of the lack of diversity in the scientific community, research proposals made by non-white scientists are often rejected, even though they often prioritize understudied groups. To combat this, the scientific workforce must be diversified to allow for a more equitable problem selection process. 15 3.1.2.2 Data collection Data collection, while a crucial part of the model development process, can cause many different ethical issues if done improperly or if biases are present. This section of the paper deals with the two overarching types of data issues - heterogeneous data loss and population-specific data loss. Heterogeneous data loss is specific to the type of data being studied. This section discusses four types of data - randomized control trials, electronic health records, administrative health data, and social media data. Randomized control trials are used to try and minimize the existence of bias in treatment. However, these trials often misrepresent populations, and require many assumptions to be made along the way that can skew the results and provide improper treatment that does not represent the entirety of a general patient population. Electronic health records make up a large percentage of healthcare machine learning data. These records include those of patients, organizations, providers, and other stakeholders. There are many reasons for EHR data biases, including gender discrimination, income disparities, access to care, or EHR system availability. Administrative health data is another portion of healthcare data that includes insurance documents, survey data, and other administrative work. These records often face ethical problems because there is strong evidence of population discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender, race, and ethnic identity, and spoken language capabilities. As a result, these policies are often unjust, which creates a severe ethical implication for the use of administrative health records. 16 Social media data, which has grown more important in recent years, can skew analyses and create issues in algorithmic development due to bias. One of the main reasons for this is that when social media data is scraped, the sample of individuals being taken will never be random. Additionally, data samples from social media are often limited to categories like type of device, geographic location, or frequency of use. These restrictions also will lead to skewed data and results. Another main contributor to data loss is the misrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain communities. This leads to bias because when algorithms output recommendations or results, these groups are then not taken into consideration, and the recommendations will not apply to the general population. The four types of population-specific data loss studied in this paper are low- and middle-income nationals, transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, undocumented immigrants, and pregnant women. 3.1.2.3 Outcome Definition The outcome definition section of this paper separates social justice issues into two healthcare outcomes that are generally used for predictive modeling: clinical diagnosis and healthcare costs. Recommendation algorithms are often used to diagnose patients in a clinical setting. One of the biggest implications with this machine learning approach in healthcare is label noise, which means that people can present in different ways while having the same diagnosis. Healthcare costs are also predicted using machine learning models - the models predict the risk of a patient to the healthcare provider, where high risk patients will likely cost the healthcare provider more. However, there is a high risk of bias in these algorithms, as healthcare costs are heavily influenced by socioeconomic circumstances. 17 3.1.2.4 Algorithm Development The next step in the model pipeline is algorithm development. However, algorithms pose many ethical issues as there can be numerous sources of bias at this stage. There are four factors that contribute to ethical issues in the algorithm development stage of the model pipeline: understanding confounding, feature selection, tuning parameters, and defining fairness. Confounding features are ones who impact the independent and dependent variables. When models are trained, they identify patterns based on what they find in the training data, but confounding features can cause models to incorrectly associate variables together even when there is no relationship. It is not enough to just control for these features. To reduce confounding effects, it is necessary to have the model design be created differently to minimize the impact of having no confounding features. Feature selection simply refers to the selection of various features to be included when analyzing data in a machine learning model. To prevent model bias, a measure that is sometimes taken is the blind addition of factors like race, gender, and income. However, this can have the opposite effect, and cause diagnostic and treatment inequalities after the model is created and used. A way to assist with this is by making sure to understand the model and those will impact before using automated feature selection. Tuning parameter biases are often the result of data that lacks diversity. When these parameters are left at default and not adjusting depending on the data, this leads to model overfitting in the training set, which results in the inability to make recommendations to an entire population. This can then harm groups that are underrepresented in the data, such as minorities or marginalized groups. Performance metrics can lead to ethical issues in algorithm development when not enough time or effort goes into carefully choosing which metrics to use. If the incorrect 18 metrics are chosen, this can lead to the misdiagnosis or mistreatment of a subsection of the population, oftentimes minorities and marginalized groups again. Defining fairness means essentially what it says. How a model defines fairness can influence which loss function is chosen for the model. If this is done incorrectly, algorithms can violate fairness definitions which then leads to bias, and individuals can once again be misdiagnosed or under- or over-treated. 3.1.2.5 Post-deployment Considerations The last portion of the pipeline is post-deployment considerations. The ethical implications during this step can be very serious, as they last long past the deployment of a model and extend beyond performance. The four factors that play into post-deployment ethical implications are quantifying impact, model generalizability, model and data documentation, and regulation. Quantifying impact post-deployment means that models must be regularly audited after they are released, particularly on different populations. Once this is done, areas of concern must be identified for future addressing. Generalization biases have been identified in almost every step of the model pipeline because it is extremely difficult to have a model that is unbiased such that its recommendations can be applied to a general population. Once a model has been deployed, it must continue to be assessed for generalizability, so see what biases are causing this hindrance. Another ethical issue that arises post-deployment is the lack of straightforward documentation. When model documentation is incomplete or inadequate, this can cause ethical issues and lead to performance and bias mishaps. Lastly, the paper mentions regulation. At this point, the FDA regulates all machine learning models used in the healthcare industry. However, 19 there is no comprehensive regulatory framework that covers every base and deals with the ethical implications of all types of models. 3.1.3 Proposed Recommendations The final section of this paper offers recommendations for the ethical concerns raised in each stage of the model pipeline. The recommendation section offers five suggestions, one for each step in the pipeline: Problem Selection - diversity in personnel and frameworks should be increased in the problem selection stage to increase the chance of achieving equity and problems that are generally overlooked should receive time and attention. Data Collection - Biases and data loss should be a high priority consideration when data is being collected, and the data should be reflective of all population groups, including minorities. Outcome Definition - If ethical issues and biases are present in outcome labels, then the model design should be improved to accommodate for such biases to minimize and remove them. Algorithm Development - Algorithm goals should be clearly defined before and during development. Drawbacks should be considered prior to deployment. Post-deployment Considerations - Audits should be performed continuously after model deployment to examine potential harm and ethical issues. 3.2 Machine Learning in Healthcare 20 “Machine Learning in Healthcare” by Nigam Shah and Alison Callahan discusses the application of machine learning to electronic health record (EHR) data analysis in clinical settings, highlighting its advantages over traditional analysis methods such as epidemiology [7]. It provides an overview of the different data analysis approaches, including inferential and predictive analyses, and explains how machine learning fits into algorithmic modeling. The paper also discusses the challenges of using machine learning in research and practice, as well as the potential opportunities for impacting health and healthcare delivery. In this section, I will leave out potential benefits described in this paper, as that can be found in section six of my thesis. The paper divides data analysis into five overarching categories: descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, and casual. The two categories that are important for this discussion about machine learning in healthcare are inferential and predictive. Inferential analyses measure a model’s goodness of fit, while a predictive analysis creates a predictive, statistical model from observations, and uses performance metrics (accuracy, discrimination, recall, calibration, predictive value, specificity) to determine which predictions are correct. This paper mainly focuses on EHR, or electronic health data, to which they claim a machine learning application is the next big step in modern clinical medicine. One application of machine learning is to classify patients that are “at risk” for a certain medical condition. In the past, scoring systems such as the DLCN criteria, Charlson Comorbidity Index, or APACHE score have been used, but they are not extremely accurate. For brief context, the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, or DLCN, is a scoring system to diagnose patients as “unlikely,” “possible,” “probable,” or “definite” for likelihood of having familial hypercholesterolemia. The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts an individual’s 1-year risk of 21 death in relation to their burden of disease. The APACHE score provides a scoring for ICU patients that tells them how severe their disease is. Machine learning algorithms can be utilized based on similar criteria used by these scoring systems and others to create predictive models that can accurately predict risk factors associated with disease. However, the development of EHR-based algorithms and machine learning models poses its own set of limitations and challenges. Firstly, patients are likely only visiting healthcare professionals when they are exhibiting symptoms of illness, which can skew a person’s risk assessment score. Additionally, missing data and data loss are a prevalent issue when using EHRs. Patients change between healthcare systems all the time, and records are often lost or re-coded incorrectly. Another major issue in this area is the lack of generalizability, or the ability to generalize the recommendations of a model to an entire population, which results in the ethical dilemma of population sectors (often minority groups) being overlooked or misrepresented. However, to combat these ethical issues, data must be easily accessible, competent machine learning engineers must be able to develop unbiased models and interpret them, and easy integration into the healthcare system must be thought through. 3.3 Ethical Limitations of Algorithmic Fairness Solutions in Health Care Machine Learning “Ethical Limitations of Algorithmic Fairness Solutions in Health Care Machine Learning” is a paper by McCradden, M. D., Joshi, S., Mazwi, M., and Anderson, J. A. It is widely understood that there are many ethical issues involved with using machine learning in healthcare [8]. As a result, algorithmic fairness solutions have been developed to combat these issues to create neutral models. However, as this paper claims, these solutions can be ethically 22 and empirically problematic, particularly when there is too much reliance on the idea of technical neutrality. In this section, I will summarize the challenges and limitations of using algorithmic fairness solutions to address pernicious bias in health data, as explained by the paper. 3.3.1 Ethical Challenges and Limitations One of the first ethical mistakes that arises with algorithmic fairness solutions is the overlooking of biological, environmental, and social elements that influence medical illnesses. These factors play a big role in healthcare and general wellbeing, but their impact is often overlooked and not well-understood Additionally, with biological differences, it is very difficult to distinguish between a biological difference necessitating different treatments and one that will promote unequal treatment if recommendations vary. The authors suggest that only causative associations should result in the incorporation of biological differences in model development. Another issue is that of a disconnect between predicted response to a treatment and actual response. In healthcare, this can have serious implications, and can prevent prompt interference. If this disconnect occurs with a “neutral” model, then the disconnect could go unnoticed by both clinicians and patients. To combat this issue, all medical consequences should be reviewed prior to fairness solution deployment. To minimize pernicious bias in algorithmic fairness solutions, the authors suggest developing a standard set of guidelines for machine learning model reporting as well as studying the resulting real-world consequences. The paper also emphasizes the importance of transparency, accountability, and clinical trials in machine learning model development and algorithmic fairness solution management. Transparency is needed at every stage of the model pipeline (see figure 4). When this is combined with straightforward model documentation, an adequate accountability system is 23 developed for fairness solutions. Clinical trials are important in that they can assess model performance before deployment and allow physicians to make data-driven judgements about their care given any drawbacks seen in the model. 3.3.2 Recommendations The authors also outline six recommendations for combating the ethical bias issue with machine learning models in healthcare. Firstly, machine learning solutions should be thought of subjectively, as to prevent reliance on neutral algorithms. Next, it is important to carefully think through and conceptualize machine learning problems to minimize pernicious, or destructive, bias. Additionally, transparency regarding model development and prediction, as well the physician-driven transparency during patient care is extremely important. There should be a standard reporting mechanism for machine learning models, as well as continuous ML solution auditing both pre- and post-deployment. Finally, it is recommended that when employing machine learning solutions in the healthcare field, to always remember that these are real people being affected, and the potential consequences should not be taken lightly. 3.4 Ethical Issues and Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Behavioral and Mental Health Care Chapter 11 of “Ethical Issues and Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Behavioral and Mental Health Care” by Luxton, D. D., Anderson, S. L., and Anderson, M. discusses ethical issues concerning using AI technology in behavioral and mental health care [9]. Specifically, the section focuses on autonomous AI, such as robots and virtual caretakers - intelligent autonomous care providers (IACP’s). This subfield is known as robo-ethics. 24 3.4.1 Ethics Background The authors define the four parts of medical ethics to be respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Respect for autonomy refers to a patient’s free will, including rights to self-determination and the reception of full disclosure of information. This cornerstone allows for patients to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Beneficence is the assumption that the motive of healthcare providers is to improve the wellbeing of their patients. Nonmaleficence, or do no harm, means that physicians and care providers will not act in a harmful way to patients or society. Finally, justice refers to the fact that patients in similar health situations should be treated similarly. Additionally, under justice, the impact of resource allocation should be constantly assessed and re-assessed. The chapter also outlines the history of medical ethics, of which the first formal ethical code was published in 1847 by the American Medical Association. There were a few follow-up codes by the British Medical Association and World Medical Association, and in 1949, the WHO (World Health Organization) released the International Code of Medical Ethics. Many other medical associations have since followed suit, including the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and American Counseling Association. The authors then go on to define roboethics and machine ethics. Roboethics is the subfield of ML ethics that has to do with the creation and design of robots, as well as how people interact with robots. Some ethical concerns relating to roboethics include the treatment of robots, whether they have rights, and whether mistreating robots will lead to the eventual, subconscious mistreatment of humans. Machine ethics, on the other hand, involves building IACP’s in a way that forces them to act ethically towards humans and other machines, and gives them the 25 capability to make ethical decisions. Machine ethics is important because it reduces the need for damage control by installing preventative measures in robots through built-in ethical principles. 3.4.2 Ethical Challenges Next, the paper details specific ethics challenges: Therapeutic Relationships and Emotional Reactions, Competence of Intelligent Machines, Patient Safety, Respect of Privacy and Trust, Deception and Appearance, and Responsibility. In this subsection, I will describe each of these challenges. Therapeutic Relationships: These are the professional relationships between healthcare providers and their patients. Because physicians and providers are in positions of power, there is a possibility for patients to be exploited or harmed. In mental healthcare specifically, which is one of the main topics of this paper, patients often experience high emotions, and it is important for professionals to respect these emotions without violating the patient’s trust or invalidating their feelings. When IACP’s replicate the position of these professionals, designers must consider the ethical involvement of the robots and virtual humans and be able to design them in such a way that this does not become an issue. An important implication of this design process that has arisen through the increased use of IACP’s in mental healthcare is the failure for the machines to be sensitive to emotional reactions from patients - handling these situations incorrectly could harm the patient and those around them. Similarly, it is important in a clinical psychology setting for the physician and patient to establish empathetic understanding. An ethical implication associated with using machine learning technology in this sense is called the ELIZA effect, when people mis-perceive machines to possess humanistic qualities such as emotional intelligence. For background, ELIZA was an MIT-engineered chatbot program that 26 allowed for natural language conversation between humans and computers [10]. ELIZA was a very intelligent program that could simulate real conversations between people, entrancing users. However, many people abused this program because they mis-perceived the intrinsic, non-human characteristics of ELIZA to be human. As a result, they would develop a dangerous relationship with the chatbot, often revealing very intimate, personal details about themselves and others. While having very humanistic computer programs can be beneficial in some cases, when the goal is to completely replace the human component of a medical interaction, but often will cause more harm than benefit. This is because the ELIZA effect can lead to patients becoming too attached to the IACPs, to a dangerous extent, and if they perceive the relationship as becoming negative in some way, have the potential to harm themselves or others. Competence of Intelligent Machines: a general assumption when meeting with a mental healthcare professional is their competence, or ability to appropriately do their job. Incompetent medical professionals could lead to a patient being harmed and an entire profession or organization losing its credibility. When dealing with human professionals, healthcare organizations have sections in their ethical codes that highlight the importance of professional competency. However, IACP systems are not always designed to perform to the highest level of competence, which poses a serious ethical problem when dealing with the medical system. Patient Safety: In clinical settings, patient safety can be compromised in many ways - the paper describes a situation where a patient discloses intent to harm another person, and the physician must follow duty-to-warn and notify authorities and others. However, this can compromise patient confidentiality, and many ethical dilemmas arise when trying to tread the fine line between these. The same issue is present when using IACP’s, particularly because IACP’s lack the human capabilities required to help make such judgements. 27 Respect of privacy and trust: With a human healthcare professional, privacy and trust can always be violated and misused. When data is involved, this issue becomes even more common, as the violation no longer needs to be intentional. Private data can be accidentally left unsecured, or intentionally accessed by hackers. Additionally, conversations between patients and IACP’s have the potential to be recorded and saved, whereas this is less common in in-person settings. Additionally, the dual-use feature capability of such machines could result in the loss of human trust. Dual-use means that a single machine can be used for multiple purposes - for example, a machine designed for mental healthcare can be repurposed and used to interrogate a high-security prisoner. As a result, the person using the machine for mental health assistance may have decreased trust in its effectiveness and capability to keep information private and secure. Deception and Appearance: The main issue with deception and appearance discussed in this article is called The Wizard-of-Oz effect. This occurs when patients, particularly those with mental issues of delusion or psychosis may believe that a machine has more capabilities than it does or is “alive”. This can be harmful both to the patient and the machine. The patient may develop an emotional relationship with the machine, which can grow unsettling and dangerous very quickly. Additionally, patients may begin enacting force upon the machine if they believe it is alive, which could cause the machine to work less effectively. Responsibility: The final implication posed by the paper is that of responsibility, or more specifically, who should be held responsible for the actions of IACP’s. In healthcare, when machines are put in control of making healthcare decisions for patients, there can be a severe implication of responsibility if anything goes wrong, because the machines cannot be held responsible as doctors can. However, when a machine is referred to as “autonomous”, this transfers some responsibility to the IACP, as it is thought of as a decision-making tool with 28 agency. But machines do not exhibit moral consequential feelings, such as guilt, humiliation, stress, etc. Therefore, the question becomes whether the responsibility should lie with the designers, the users, or a hybrid of both, and how such ethical issues should be dealt with. 3.4.3 Ethical Challenge Recommendations To address issues with therapeutic relationships and emotional reactions, the authors suggest that ethical codes and guidelines be updated to consider these relationships, their issues, and subsequent consequences. The paper advises that the best course of action to handle the ethical issue of competency will be to train the users and adjust the design of IACP systems. Users must be aware of what they are signing up for when using IACP’s and understand the drawbacks of these systems. Additionally, systems should be designed such that they are acting ethically towards humans, and trained to specifically handle cases that they are dealing with. The paper provides an example about IACP’s only being accessible to those with depression if the machine is specifically designed to care for those people. Additionally, manufacturers should make sure to display the capabilities and qualifications of their machines very clearly so that the users can make informed decisions about whether to use the IACP’s. Additionally, there should be an existing process for users to submit issues and have them resolved. To deal with patient safety, the authors state that IACP’s must be capable of monitoring and assessing the risk of patient harm and be able to apply decision making skills and judgment towards deciding ethical courses of action. Additionally, back-up measures should be instituted should an IACP fail in such a situation. Standard guidelines for clinical best practices should be followed by IACP’s as well. 29 To address privacy and trust concerns, it is necessary for machines to be equipped with detailed information on its purpose, scope, and capabilities. Additionally, details about data collection and storage should be shared with IACP users, as well as whether the machines adhere to safety and privacy guidelines. Deception and appearance issues can be ameliorated through decreasing how much a machine resembles a human, and how realistic the outward design is. Many of the deception and appearance issues caused by IACP’s occur because the machines resemble a human and patients are more likely to treat the machine as such if this is the case. Although the ideal level of realism is yet to be determined, these ethical considerations are very important when determining the design of an IACP used in healthcare. There are currently no specific measures in place to deal with the ethical implication of responsibility in IACP’s. A recommendation provided by the authors is that the legal burden should lie with the designers of machines but extend to the user if the technology is used inappropriately. The authors also suggest that as autonomous machines are used more frequently and for more complex situations, the decision processes of these machines should be properly detailed if there are ever ethically murky situations, as well as legal restrictions on use. 3.4.4 Design and Testing Recommendations This paper highlights two recommendations that involve testing and analysis that would aid with the moral and ethical dilemmas caused using IACP’s in healthcare. These are called the Turing test and GenEth. The Turing test measures whether a machine is of similar intelligence to a human and performs in a way that mimics the intelligent behavior of a human. To combat ethical issues, a 30 Moral Turing Test (MTT) is referenced in this paper. To deal with IACP’s, the normal Turing Test would be insufficient - the test would need to have some aspect of ethical examination. In this version, both the machine and the human subject or doctor would be faced with an ethical dilemma, and their responses and actions to the dilemma would be recorded. The judge would then blindly compare the actions to see whether the machine is performing actions that are ethically responsible when compared to the human. The drawback to this test is that critics have said it is not enough to prove whether a machine is moral or not. Another version of the MTT, developed by the Andersons, compares the actions of a machine in an ethical dilemma to that of an ethicist when faced with the same dilemma, rather than a doctor or other human. In this version, if a machine’s actions match the actions of the ethicist, the machine can be considered ethically responsible. The previously mentioned Andersons also developed an analysis tool, GenEth, that analyzes and codifies ethical principles for any ethically harmful situation. Using inductive logic as the basis for its engineering, GenEth can not only respond to real situations, but can also make predictions and determinations about untested situations. Although GenEth has not yet entered the mental healthcare domain, its decision-making aid would be very beneficial to ethical dilemmas in the mental health space. 5 Final Recommendations Through my review of existing literature across four subsections, I have identified the following issues to be the most prominent ethical concerns when utilizing machine learning algorithms in the healthcare industry: fairness, safety and privacy, transparency, and accountability. Below, I have created a table summarizing recommendations from the four 31 research papers regarding how to minimize consequences when faced with ethical dilemmas in these four areas. Figure 5.

These are outlined best by the papers “Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Medicine: Promises, Ethical Challenges and Governance”, “Machine Learning in Healthcare” and “Open-Source Clinical Machine Learning Models: Critical Appraisal of Feasibility, Advantages, and Challenges”. 32 6.1 Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Medicine: Promises, Ethical Challenges and Governance In “Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Medicine: Promises, Ethical Challenges and Governance” by Jian Guan, AI in medicine is organized into three categories: virtual, physical, and a combination of both [11]. Virtual AI, using machine learning, can detect patterns in data to predict data trends or facilitate decision-making under uncertain conditions. This technology has proven valuable in genetics, molecular medicine, and precision medicine, allowing for the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. It can also optimize clinical trials and simplify process management while reducing costs. Physical AI, represented by robots, assists elderly patients or attending surgeons in aged care settings or complex surgeries using a minimally invasive approach. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) form a communication pathway between the central nervous system and an output, improving the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders such as spinal cord injuries, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In 2018, the FDA approved the first AI-based diagnostic system, IDx-DR, which detects diabetic retinopathy and makes screening decisions independently from a clinician. AI has shown great potential in prediction, imaging, pathological diagnoses, and treatments. Researchers are also developing biohybrids by engineering miniaturized interfaces between living and artificial systems, learning from nature to develop innovative AI solutions. Communication and collaboration between AI and the neuroscience field have become commonplace in the era of digital healthcare. 6.2 Machine Learning in Healthcare 33 As mentioned in section 3.2, “Machine Learning in Healthcare” by Alison Callahan and Nigam H. Shah focuses on the use of electronic health records (EHRs) as a technological development in healthcare [7]. The “Opportunities for machine learning in healthcare” section of this paper discusses the potential advantages of using EHR data for predictive modeling. The authors explain that a great opportunity in this field is the adoption of machine learning models that can categorize patients into different risk groups. This has the potential to greatly impact healthcare value and bring clinical practice closer to precision medicine. Additionally, identifying high-risk and high-cost patients in time for targeted intervention will become increasingly necessary as healthcare providers take on more financial risk in treating their patients. This can be done with predictive modeling, which has already begun to successfully be implemented in medical practice, resulting in more efficient and better-quality care. These models have also been applied to hospital and practice management, streamlining operations, and improving patient outcomes. The paper states that there is ample opportunity for predictive modeling to enable proactive treatment, more efficient use of resources, and deliver better care at a lower cost, as seen in other industries that have incorporated machine learning into their workflows. 6.3 Open-Source Clinical Machine Learning Models: Critical Appraisal of Feasibility, Advantages, and Challenges “Open-Source Clinical Machine Learning Models: Critical Appraisal of Feasibility, Advantages, and Challenges” is a paper by Keerthi B Harish, BA; W Nicholson Price, JD; Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs, MD, PhD [12]. The authors identify four main advantages to using open-source machine learning in healthcare. First, the transparency of open-source data and 34 software allows for the widespread assessment of a specific model’s performance, which allows for many people to validate these models. Currently, many models that are used in healthcare require proprietary software, whereas the open-source tools would allow for a faster and more accurate ability to improve technological performance and capabilities. Next, the use of open-source technology allows hospitals to customize models to fit their specific population, which is important because ML tools are developed using data sets from large cohorts and applied to individuals, resulting in varying levels of safety and efficacy across different populations. This issue is referred to as the ""curly braces problem"" in medical informatics, where model performance degrades when implemented in new settings. However, by using open-source models, facilities can adjust the model weighting to optimize performance for their unique patient populations. This customization can increase safety and efficacy, as different departments within a hospital may require slightly different model calibrations. The ability to personalize care through the adjustment of source code is a valuable benefit of open-source technology. The third advantage to open-source options is that they include lower cost options which could allow for a quicker and easier integration process of machine learning in clinical practice. The paper explains that the concept of open-source models is characterized by the availability of their code. Transparency is a hallmark of these models, which have typically been less expensive than proprietary options in the past. However, despite significant investment from developers and investors, the healthcare sector has been slow to adopt machine learning (ML) technologies due in part to concerns by clinicians and administrators about potential financial and value-based repercussions. This hesitancy has hindered the implementation of ML tools, particularly among 35 hospitals that are new to this technology. To encourage experimentation, reducing the financial risks associated with adoption may be helpful. The final potential benefit of (low-cost) open-source options is that they may increase competition, leading to changes in both pricing and functionality. While open-source models have become more popular, proprietary technology is still being developed. However, facilities may have to choose between proprietary and open-source options when using deep learning. The availability of open-source models may push proprietary developers to improve their offerings in order to justify their higher prices. This could lead to improvements in areas such as user interface, integration with existing IT systems, or implementation guidance and maintenance. 7 Conclusion Incorporating machine learning techniques in the healthcare industry poses a wide array of potential benefits, but it is important to acknowledge that there are many challenges that arise with this technological advancement. This paper provides a background for the machine learning knowledge needed to understand the various algorithms being introduced in the healthcare industry, as well as four areas in which advancements are currently being made. To do so, I analyzed the ethical implications posed by four different papers, as well as the recommendations suggested by the authors. Through this, I was able to compile a comprehensive list of recommendation suggestions in four areas of ethical concern. I concluded this paper on a more promising note, with a brief analysis of the benefits offered by utilizing machine learning solutions in healthcare. 36 8 References 1. Tondak, A.

Keywords: 3D printing drug products; Continuous Manufacturing; Nanotechnology; Digital Healthcare Technology; Informatics; Functional Materials; 2D materials. 3 Precise, Rapid, and Timely Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) processes are a collection of state-of-the-art fabrication techniques that are capable of generating structural features in the order of micron to nano-size [1, 2]. EHD techniques have been used to fabricate nanofibers, nanoribbons, and spherical nanoparticles [3-7]. The technology leverages voltage-control for high precision fabrication in a reproducible manner [8]. Moreover, the standard EHD setup is simple, inexpensive and compact. As it is a solvent-based fabrication technique and does not require high heat, a wide range of polymers can be used. However, in contrast to other solvent-based techniques, the drying times are considerably fast, making it a uniquely rapid-fabrication process. In addition, as high temperature is not required, biological and thermally-labile materials can be incorporated, as well as hybridised products containing ceramics and metals [1, 9]. Furthermore, highly porous structures, up to 90% porosity, can be obtained yielding high surface area-to-volume ratio, which is a requirement for certain applications [3, 10, 11]. These aforementioned remarkable properties of EHD highlight why the technology is employed across a number of sectors, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, sensors and energy harvesting [12, 13]. With its broad application and several EHD products successfully progressed towards clinical or industrial application (Table 1), the technology warrants further research. One promising research is the transition from two- to three-dimensional printing (3DP) EHD processes. For example, EHD can achieve features on a scale magnitude smaller than that of current 3DP technologies, resulting in highly sensitive biosensor electrodes. Moreover, the morphology of some products has been found to replicate the extracellular matrix that facilitates biocompatibility, and which current 3DP technology-based scaffolds are unable to. Hence, due to these specialised properties, 3DP-EHD technologies are expected to become a staple 3DP technology complimenting existing 3DP technologies [14]. The transition to a 3DP technology will undoubtedly require a period of optimisation in order to realise this aim. Recent research has revealed that 3DP technologies that are an extension of conventional 2D fabrication technologies were not always compatible with existing formulations. In addition, the conventional 2D-EHD processes are far from having their full potential realised. For one, large scale production are yet to be realised, despite the technology being around for decades. The technology is highly complex, with each parameter playing an important role and has interdependent influence on the characteristics of the particles or fibres produced. Of course, the ability of EHD to accommodate a wide range of materials is advantageous, however, it is inescapable that exploring the influence of each parameter will be laborious (Table 2). The currently used trial-and-error approach is antiquated and unsustainable, requiring large resources of materials and time. In addition, some healthcare applications of EHD, such as point-of-care wound dressing fabrication, will ideally need to be situated in healthcare facilities – nearer to the patient, on-demand and personalised. However, this will require on-site expertise, which can be costly for healthcare institutes. 4 Table 1.

Such simulations help to reduce the exhaustive trial-and-error approach to obtaining data whilst minimising material consumption. The state-of-the-art in modelling is Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that is strongly implicated in the next healthcare revolution [19-21]. ML is the process of developing algorithms to learn from data and help develop predictive models therefrom [22, 23]. ML is a widely versatile predictive technique, capable of making predictions from a variety of inputs, including numeric, text, images and videos. In addition, the predictions can be made in a matter of seconds, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications, such as in healthcare [24]. The recent application of deep learning, a subset of ML, has demonstrated that algorithms can be developed that improve their predictions as the data size grows, having previously considered ‘Big data’ to be an obstacle in ML. Due to these outstanding and unprecedented properties, the success of both AI and ML has garnered much attention, with well-publicised success stories such as AlphaGo and AlphaFold, and some algorithms have outperformed clinicians in diagnostic tests [25-27]. As a consequence, a number of research disciplines have incorporated ML, chief among them the drug discovery discipline [28] and other healthcare-related applications (Table 3). However, the adoption of ML in the wider material science and engineering field has not been thoroughly explored, even though the field is heavily data-driven. Hence, given the large existing available data, there is potential to employ ML in material science to help expedite research and development. To that end, the current paper reviews the application of ML applied in EHD processes, the principal objective being to introduce ML to the EHD community. A section providing essential background to ML is presented first, highlighting the examples of common ML techniques (MLT) and their learning methods, as well as describing the overall ML pipeline itself. The following section summarises the application of ML in EHD, before concluding the paper by providing a perspective on the outlook on this emerging multidisciplinary field. 6 Table 3. A number of Machine Learning Algorithms are being investigated for clinical use. Algorithm Clinical Application Ref Random Forest Clinical Trial design [29] Artificial Neural Networks Powering Exoskeletons [30] Convolutional Neural Networks Image recognition software [31] Principal Component Analysis diagnostic [32] k-means diagnostic [32] Support Vector Machine Diagnostics [33] Recurrent Neural Networks Diagnostics [34] Gaussian Mixture Model Imaging [35] Machine Learning Principles ML focuses on algorithms that train prediction- or decision-making models based on data provided [36].The exponential increase of computational power and the advancement of ML algorithms have enormously accelerated the application of ML in a myriad of fields not limited to computer science but also biology [25], chemistry [37], materials science [38, 39], and pharmaceutical science [40-43]. On top of applications in academia, ML is also having a huge impact on industries, of which facial recognition, text translation, and self-driving cars are classic examples [44-46]. ML encompasses several categories of learning methods. Depending on the information the training data contains, ML can be divided into two major categories of supervised learning and unsupervised learning [47, 48]. These algorithms are discussed in detail in the following section. Supervised learning Supervised learning is a popular and widely used method in ML [48]. During the training process, the data are fed into the learning algorithm f in the form of (𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒, 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙) pairs. Taking linear regression as an example, dots that contain (𝑥, 𝑦) positions are the (𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒, 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙) pairs in the training step. Training with (𝑥, 𝑦) pairs allows the regression algorithm 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑔 to build up a model that gives a prediction of ?̂? with a query input 𝑥 . Other than numeric (𝑥, 𝑦) input, the input features can also be medical images, molecular graphs, or texts (DNA sequence or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)) in different algorithms [49-51]. Table 4 shows different learning algorithms in supervised learning to which the well-known multiple linear regression, support vector classification (SVC), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) belong. An illustration of several ML techniques is shown in Figure 1. Briefly, multiple linear regression (MLR) learns a linear combination of features ?̂? = 𝜽𝑻𝒙 + 𝑏 that minimizes the squared error of the predicted value to the ground truth value. Similarly, logistic regression (LR) uses a linear combination of features 𝜽𝑻𝒙 + 𝑏 but then takes the combined result and feeds it into a logistic 7 function to do classification tasks. k-Nearest neighbours (kNN) algorithm approaches classification by a simple plurality vote of k nearest neighbours. The label of the predicting sample will be assigned to the most common class amongst its neighbours. Support vector classification seeks the hyperplane 𝜽𝑻𝒙 + 𝑏 = 0 that separates samples of different categories the most. Moreover, non-linear classification can be performed by SVC with the help of kernel methods [52]. Naïve Bayes algorithm adopts the Bayes’ theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the predicting sample’s label based on prior known samples in the training step [36]. Decision tree (DT) uses a series of simple rules (e.g., comparing with criteria) to predict [53]. Random forest (RF) uses an ensemble learning method ‘bagging’ which combines the prediction results from many different decision trees and gives a final prediction by a majority vote in classification or averaging the output in regression [54]. Also based on DT, gradient boost decision tree (GBDT) belongs to the ‘boosting’ ensemble learning method. GBDT takes the output of one decision tree and feed it to another decision tree, forming a series connection of models [55]. MLP is a basic structure of artificial neural networks (ANN) consisting of multiple layers of neurons [56]. Here we adopt a broader definition of MLP where the activation function is not limited to the threshold function. A classic structure of MLP consists the input layer, hidden layer(s), and the output layer. These layers are connected by activation functions like rectified linear function (ReLU), sigmoid function, or tanh function. Backpropagation (BP) trains parameters in the MLP network, minimizing the loss function. Because of the non-linear nature of the activation functions, MLP performs well in capturing non-linear relationships between the features and the labels [57]. Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are specialized neural networks designed to handle image and serial (e.g., texts and audio) inputs [44, 58, 59]. 8 Figure 1.

(y – response variable; 𝜽𝑻𝒙 – denotes the input features; P- is probability; fkernel – kernel function; ℝ - real numbers; n - number). Unsupervised learning Unlike supervised learning, the input data of unsupervised learning algorithms are without labels [60]. Unsupervised learning algorithms are able to find the intrinsic patterns of data based on different assumptions [48]. Several unsupervised learning algorithms are shown in Table 4. Conventional unsupervised learning algorithms mainly tackle two tasks: clustering and dimensionality reduction [60]. Figure 2 includes some unsupervised learning algorithms. k-means clustering algorithm partitions the data to k clusters by finding out the minimum in-cluster variance. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) assumes data are generated from several Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters and aims to find out the underlying distributions to cluster the data. Dimensionality reduction aims to address the ‘curse of dimensionality’, caused by the sparsity of data (i.e. not enough data to fill up the high-dimensional feature space to reach statistical significant conclusions), by detecting and removing the redundancy in features. Principal component analysis (PCA) finds a lower-dimensional representation by linearly transforming original data while maximizing the variance in the new sample space [61]. Recently, 9 novel unsupervised learning algorithms including variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) target new data generation from the learned latent pattern of training data [62, 63]. In certain scenarios, pre-trained CNN and RNN are used for unsupervised feature extraction for image and text data. Figure 2.

Most of the time, unprocessed raw data will dramatically limit, if not completely hinder, the performance of ML algorithms. Especially in materials science and chemistry, crystal and molecular information is represented by a chemical formula or a molecular graph which can be easily understood and interpreted by human experts. However, such information is not sufficient nor valid as the input of ML algorithms like multiple linear regression. Hence, appropriate feature engineering should be carried out on the raw data. For organic molecules and crystals, molecular fingerprints and crystal descriptors are introduced to enable computers to understand chemical and structural information [92, 93]. Apart from molecules, different data types usually require specific feature engineering techniques [91]. Numeric data need to be normalized or transformed into the logarithm scale. Image data need to be resized or cropped. Text data should be vectorized by featurization methods like bag-of-words. Regarding the refinement of extracted features, the number of features is the major concern. Furthermore, in feature engineering, some unsupervised learning algorithms like PCA are applied to rule out the redundancy in data [91, 94]. In short, feature engineering is the preparation of raw data and making it ready for the further training process. A summary of common feature engineering techniques is presented in Table 5. Table 5 Summary of common Feature Engineering Techniques Feature Engineering Techniques Input Benefits Ref Scaling, normalization, log-transform Numerical Speed up convergence, balance weight between features, prevent fast saturation of activation functions [91] Bag-of-Words, Word2Vec Text Embed words into vectors [95] Convolutional Neural Networks Image Extract edges and structural features in images [58, 59] Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) Molecules Transfer molecular information into text expression [96-98] Morgan fingerprints, Mol2Vec, Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) Molecules Transfer molecular information into vector expression [99-101] 13 Matminer, ElemNet Inorganic Crystals Describe inorganic materials with crystal information [102, 103] Model training and hyper-parameter tuning As the parameters of EHD need to be optimized (Table 2, e.g. voltage, collector distance, etc.), so do the parameters for the ML algorithms. In most ML algorithms, hyper-parameters are available for further adjustment of the structure or learning behaviour of the model. For instance, in MLP, the number of neurons and hidden layers determine the complexity of the network, making them critical hyperparameters in the model which govern the overfitting or underfitting of the network [104]. Overfitting refers to the conditions where the network remembers all the training data, resulting in the training accuracy close to 100%. However, the overfitted model is not robust and yields weaker prediction accuracy in the following evaluation process. Hyper-parameters should be fine-tuned based on different training tasks to optimize the model performance. Common methods of hyper-parameter searching include random search, grid search, and Bayesian optimization [105]. These methods try out different hyper-parameters in a pre-set manner, compare the performance of each hyper-parameter set, and present the one with the best performance measured by user-determined performance metrics [106]. As the name suggests, random search explores the parameter space in a random manner, and selects the parameters that yielded the optimum prediction value (e.g. highest accuracy) [107]. Grid search, on the other hand, is more structured to tuning the parameters, where the user selects the range of parameters to examine. Taking neural network as an example, the user will request specific values of hidden layers to be examined [108]. Model Evaluation Evaluating the model provides essential information about the performance. The data can be first divided into training/validation/test sets before training. Model performance on the test set is regarded as the performance of a model in real application scenarios. Sometimes validation and test sets are not distinguished, and the data will only be separated into training/test sets. The ratio of the training set to the test set is not fixed but is normally taken as 80/20 [42]. In datasets with limited data size, cross-validation (CV) is a useful technique performed to make full use of all data [109]. Multiple methods are available for CV [110]. By splitting the training set into 𝑘 groups, 𝑘 − 1 groups are treated as the training set and the remaining one group is used as the validation set, as shown in Figure 3(A). Then, model training and validation are performed 𝑘 times so that all groups have been treated as the validation set. This technique is called 𝑘-fold CV. In extreme conditions where 𝑘 equals to the sample size 𝑛 such that one group only has one sample, the technique is referred to as leave-one-out CV (LOOCV). The overall performance of a model in CV is calculated by averaging the performance metrics over all rounds of CV [111, 112]. 14 There is a wide range of metrics that are used [110]. For classification tasks, accuracy is the salient metric, which is the ratio of correct predictions to that of the total number of predictions. Other common metrics include sensitivity and specificity, which are common in medical diagnostics since it is pertinent to evaluate both the true positives and true negatives. An illustration of a few metrics applied in ML tasks is shown in Figure 3(B). The matrix here between the predicted and ground truth value is known as the confusion matrix. In material science domain, researchers are mainly interested in the true positives (i.e. ‘Does it work?’). For example, ML was applied to 3D printing where researchers were only interested in how well an algorithm was able to identify which formulations were printable, and less interested in how well the algorithm was able to identify which formulations were unprintable [24]. Here, the metrics precision and recall were applied. Precision evaluates how well an algorithm is able to identify the true positives from all that are predicted as positives. Taking the 3D printing study as an example, a precision of 80% resulted in 20% of formulations being predicted as printable which were in fact not printable. Moreover, the F1-score, calculated from the harmonic mean of precision, is widely used in classification tasks by taking both aspects into consideration. A valuable question in ML is how to establish a baseline value for classification tasks, such that the prediction of the ML algorithm is useful. Here, the Cohen’s kappa (k), the Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) have been employed. These metrics compare the performance of the ML algorithm to random prediction, where a value of 0 for Cohen’s kappa and MCC and a value of 0.5 for AUROC indicates the ML performance to be the same as random prediction [113-115]. 15 Figure 3 (A) Train-Test split and cross-validation step. (B) The confusion matrix and metrics used for evaluating ML model performance. (k – constant; TP – true positive; TN – true negative; FP – false positive; FN – false negative) For regression tasks, the metrics aim to measure the difference between the predicted value ?̂? to the ground truth value 𝑦. A well-known and widely used metric is mean squared error (MSE), expressed as: 𝟏𝒏∑ (𝒚𝒊 − ?̂?𝒊)𝟐𝒏𝒊 Equation 1 (where n is the number of samples, i is the index and ∑ is the summation). For which the square root is sometimes taken, giving the root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE and MSE metrics are used extensively in linear regression scenarios to evaluate the performance of regression. Similarly, the mean absolute error (MAE) takes the absolute value of the difference between ?̂? and 𝑦: 𝟏𝒏∑ |𝒚𝒊 − ?̂?𝒊|𝒏𝒊 Equation 2 The coefficient of determination, also known as the R2 score, represents the goodness of the fit. However, relying only on the R2 score does not necessarily guarantee a good fitting model. The 16 R2 metric is normally reported with other metrics including MSE and MAE. These metrics, together with a plot that depict 𝑦 − ?̂? relationship, are often used to represent the performance of a regression model [116]. Model Deployment Another advantage of machine learning is the ability to integrate it into a production-ready platform. The convention in research when developing an optimization model, such as design of experiment (DoE) or finite element analysis (FEA), is to report the findings and possibly the effects of the different input parameters. In contrast, deploying ML in the form of a web-based software, which has been countlessly performed [24, 117-120], allows other researchers to leverage the optimization technique without needing prior knowledge in developing ML models. Further to deploying ML models in the form of web-based services, ML models have also been embedded in sensors [121, 122]. There are many considerations when translating into production ready products [123]. For computational performance consideration needs to be given to the scalability of the algorithm [124]. Moreover, as most algorithms are not autonomous, they will have to be regularly trained as the dataset expands [125]. Lastly, models tend to degrade, and thus will require regular inspection [126, 127]. The complete ML pipeline is illustratively summarised in Figure 4. Figure 4. Schematic depicting the stages of the ML pipeline. Machine Learning for Electrohydrodynamic Processes The goal of ML for EHD processes is to expedite the workflow through predicting key processing parameters that otherwise would require an exhaustive trial-and-error approach. Moreover, working with relatively expensive materials such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) can result in a costly endeavour for the sake of optimization. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that ML can predict key processing variables; the most common ML application in EHD processing has been the prediction of fibre dimensions using ANN (Figure 5 & Table 6). The dimensions of electrospun fibres govern the quality of the product, influencing characteristics such as mechanical strength and porosity, through to more niche applications such as drug release in pharmaceutics and conductivity in biosensors [128]. Given the thickness of the fibres 17 typically ranging from nano to micrometer, most studies employ SEM imaging to measure the fibre diameter. However, SEM is a costly and sample-destructive characterization technique; thus the use of ML can minimise the need for SEM imaging. The importance of predicting the fibre diameter has attracted a great deal of interest, with researchers using DoE to establish a viable optimization technique. However, DoE requires specific experiments to be conducted, seldom applied to data already obtained, and struggles to handle noisy and highly correlated data. Moreover, even if a given experiment is known to fail, DoE will still need the experiment to be performed in order to build the model, at the expense of material and time. ML on the other hand can overcome the aforementioned issues, and hence less effort is spent by researchers in preparing the data. A more pertinent advantage is that ML was reported to outperform a DoE quadratic model in predicting fibre diameter (Figure 5(D)) [129, 130]. Inputs used to build ANN models, i.e. the independent parameter, generally include polymer weight fraction, solvent concentration, temperature of the media, applied voltage and the collector distance; these are readily obtainable and do not require additional characterisation techniques. This strategy has been successful in predicting the fibre diameter for a broad range of polymers, including polyethylene oxide, nylon, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, as well as biopolymers such as gelatin, chitosan blended with polyvinyl alcohol and kefiran (Table 6). The neural network architectures developed do vary between the different studies, generally ranging from 1 to 3 hidden layers, suggesting that a deep and complex architecture is not necessarily needed to predict the fibre diameter, and thus the models are computationally undemanding. The models developed have been on small datasets of fewer than 50 formulations, which demonstrates that a model with good accuracy can be rapidly developed. The popularity of using ANN is further highlighted when compared with other ML algorithms. Two studies by Kalantary et al. (2019 & 2020) demonstrated ANN outperformed SVM and MLR (Figure 5(C)) [131, 132]. In one study, they reported R2 of 0.83 and 0.96 for SVM and ANN, respectively. The MAE were 60 and 0.097, respectively. In other words, ANN was able to achieve a remarkable error of +/- 0.097 nm on average in predicting the fibre diameter. When comparing ANN to MLR, the former yielded a superior accuracy, with R2 of 0.96 and 0.56, respectively. The inability of MLR to achieve a good agreement in modelling the fibre diameter infers that the relationship between the input and target variables are nonlinear, whereas ANN can model nonlinear relationships. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. 18 19 Figure 5 ANN is a powerful modelling technique in EHD. (A(i)) An example of ANN used to predict the fibre diameter using three inputs. (A(ii)) The number of hidden neurons can vary but this study found that increasing the number of hidden neurones resulted in lower prediction error [133]. (B) ANN can also simultaneously predict multiple outputs, which in this study was the drug release at 24, 48 and 96 hours, as well as whether burst release was observed (Y4) [134]. (C(i)) High accuracies were obtained using ANN, (C(ii)) particularly when compared to multi-linear regression [131]. (D(i)) Study revealed that DoE performed poorly in predicting fibre diameter compared to (D(ii)) ANN [129]. (X – denotes the input feature; Y – denotes the target variable; T – target) Table 6.

ANN are used to generate sensitivity analysis to determine the importance of the input variables. Generally, the starting composition has the largest influence on the final product, where analysed. The figure presents examples of sensitivity analysis for (A) the elastic modulus of Polycaprolactone/gelatin blend [140]; and the fibre diameter for (B) polycaptolactone/gelatin blends [131]; (C) polyurethane [147]; (D) poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) [135]; and poly vinyl alcohol composite [138]. (S – denotes Significance) 22 Some of the studies using ANN applied sensitivity analysis to determine the relationship between electrospinning parameters and fibre diameter [129], whereas others used surface response plots to determine the relationship. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify how ‘sensitive’ a model is to change when the input is varied [148]. For producing starch fibres, the ANN modelling elucidated an inverse relationship between fibre diameter and both spinning distance (5-8 cm) and voltage (6-10 kV), whereas a proportional relationship between starch concentration and fibre diameter was observed (10-15 w/v%) [129]. For PVP, increasing the polymer concentration (8-20 wt%) or voltage (13-23) was found to increase fibre diameter (10-20 cm), whereas increasing the spinning distance was found to decrease fibre diameter [135]. The analysis was more complicated for electrospinning nylon fibres [136]. Although the relationship between nylon concentration (16-25 w/v%) and fibre diameter was the same as the aforementioned studies, both the effect of spinning distance (6-20 cm) and voltage (16-26 kV) varied depending on the nylon concentration. For example, low and high polymer concentrations revealed an inverse relationship between spinning distance and fibre diameter, whereas at medium concentration the relationship was proportional. Maurya et al. (2020) investigated the relationship between processing parameters at specific fibre diameters of 280 and 500 nm of polyvinyl alcohol fibres blended with iron oxide nanoparticles [138]. A relative importance was derived from the ANN model, that revealed flow rate was positively correlated to fibre diameter, whereas voltage had a negative effect, and the rotating drug speed had a negligible effect. Interestingly, the study revealed the spinning distance to have a positive correlation on fibre diameter for producing fibres with 280 nm diameters, however the distance was found to have a negligible effect for fabricating fibres at the larger diameter of 500 nm. Thus, from these results it is evident that the relationship between processing parameters and fibre diameters can vary with the starting polymer. Figure 6 presents examples of sensitivity analysis. Aside from fibre diameter, the mechanical properties of the fibres have also been modelled using ML (Table 6). Although EHD can produce aligned fibres once optimised, electrospun materials typically result in non-uniform, anisotropic mechanical properties, which are difficult to model. Previous work has used finite element analysis (FEA) to model the mechanical properties of electrospun fibres, demonstrating a high resemblance to experimental data [149, 150]. However, FEA requires the properties of the investigated materials to be known before modelling, which may not be accessible. In contrast, ML does not require additional characterisation techniques to develop a model, thereby obviating the need for costly experiments to be conducted. A further minor drawback is that FEA are known to be computationally demanding. On the other hand, the go-to ML algorithm, ANN, was able to achieve R2 values above 0.9 for the elastic modulus and fibre strength (Table 6). In predicting the elastic modulus, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the relative importance of various input variables in ANN simulations. When a high accurate model is obtained, a sensitivity analysis can be informative, aiding EHD users on which parameters to control to yield a maximum impact. In the aforementioned study, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the polymer composition was the most important factor in affecting the elastic modulus of samples. This confirms that the ANN model is learning the relationship between the input and output data, just as an expert user would but in a considerably shorter period. Interestingly, the same study used fibre diameter as an input in predicting the elastic modulus, where the fibre diameter was obtained via SEM imaging. As discussed earlier in this 23 section, the fibre diameter can be effectively predicted using ML, thereby potentially reducing the need for SEM or other post processing characterisation techniques in future studies for predicting the elastic modulus. Applications of ML in EHD Processing Workflow ML has also been applied to domain-specific applications. One area where EHD is garnering interest is in drug delivery because of its high degree of control over formulation design [151]. Although dissolution studies are necessity for the US FDA approval, the analysis for sustained release of drugs can last in the order of days to weeks. Hence, simulating this in vitro study can facilitate researchers in adjusting their formulations to meet a desired drug release profile, and thereby obviating the need to perform many protracted studies. Another domain-specific application of ML is predicting the removal of pollutants in wastewater treatment [144]. This is another field where EHD is attracting interest owing to its ability to process nano-sized features, and porosity design. Collectively, these studies illustrate that ML can be applied to applications where the users are more concerned with end product performance, rather than understanding the fundamentals of the processing design parameters (e.g. fibre diameter). Understandably, the complexity of domain-specific applications increases, making it challenging to be modelled with, for example, mechanistic models. In this respect, using ML may prove to be a simpler modelling approach. For example, in the case of drug dissolution, including information about drug solubility, dissolution pH and dissolution volume – in addition to EHD processing parameters – will result in a complex modelling relationship, which fortunately ML can model. The aforementioned studies demonstrate the utility of ANN for achieving good predictive performance on low-sample datasets. It is worth acknowledging that the transferability of the models is yet to be tested, whether it is changing the EHD process parameters (e.g. applied voltage, needle gauge, collecting distance, etc.), or using the same polymer but with a different molecular weight. Moreover, the models cannot be transferred to novel polymers, and so will become time consuming when a large number of polymers need to be modelled. Alternatively, polymer informatics can be exploited, wherein the inputs of the polymer pertain to their chemical structure [152]. Thus, once the ML model learns the relationship between the chemical structure to e.g. fibre diameter, it can be generalised to new polymers not found in the training set. Nevertheless, the aforementioned examples demonstrate the potency of ANN for small-scale production. Machine Learning for Image Classification What is also remarkable about ML is that a pipeline can be developed for image analysis. Undeniably, imaging is an important aspect of quality control, ensuring a defect-free product has been produced. Despite their importance, the process of scanning and analysing images can be laborious, and subject to human bias in interpreting the results. Recent work has investigated the possibility of employing ML for image classification to overcome the aforementioned issues, where it was reported that ML is capable of emulating experts in detecting defects in electrospun 24 fibres [141]. When combined with the fact that the predictions can be made in a matter of seconds, ML does indeed offer a powerful strategy to classifying images manually [141, 153]. The ‘gold standard’ in ML algorithms for images is CNN, which is a network-based ML, but compared with neural networks with similar sized layers, CNNs have fewer connections and parameters, and thus are easier to train [154]. Moreover, CNNs are able to capture the non-linearity in datasets; non-linearity is commonly found in images, such as photographs and electron micrographs, because of a number of elements [155-160]. Two studies have demonstrated the feasibility of utilising CNN for EHD process monitoring. One study investigated CNN for classifying images of the “Taylor cone jet”, which is the optimal jetting behaviour of EHD, produced during EHD processing, obtained from a digital microscope [161]. Given that environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature can have distinct effects on the Taylor cone jet mode, the processing parameters will need to be accommodated accordingly. Hence, an efficient monitoring system is required. For that work, 5000 images were taken of EHD processing of PCL solutions, in which between 500-4000 images were used to train the CNN model, 500 images were used for validation and a further 500 images were used for testing. The images were classified into eight different Taylor cone modes. It was revealed that the test accuracy increased as the training size increased from 88.9% for training on 500 images to 94.7% for training on 4000 images. In a separate study, ML was used to classify images obtained from a polarized light microscope [162]. This imaging modality is also suitable for real-time measurements. For this particular approach, pairing polarized images with CNN was found to predict accurately the morphology of electrospun PLLA and PCL, with a test accuracy of 96.15% in classifying whether the fibres were smooth, microporous or beaded [162]. Despite its high performing results, a key drawback to CNN is that the algorithm is data hungry, requiring large numbers of samples to achieve high accuracies, which may not be feasible to users who are unable to generate large datasets due to time or cost constraints. Fortunately, an alternative approach was recently demonstrated by Leracitano et al. (2020) who combined an Autoencoder (AE) with ANN, to identify defects in electrospun fibres [141]. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction are widely employed to improve the performance of MLTs [163, 164]. Although one feature of ML is its ability to compute high-dimensionality data, not every additional feature is useful (i.e. noisy). Thus, dimensionality reduction algorithms are employed to minimise the number of dimensions, with both PCA and AE found to be effective at reducing the noise in high-dimensional data [165]. PCA is the more commonly-used technique for identifying the most relevant features to use from an image, thanks to its simplicity. There is, of course, the added benefit that reducing the number of inputs can also reduce the computational demands of the process, resulting in a faster prediction time. Whilst PCA has been demonstrated to be effective for feature selection, it is limited to linear features. AE on the other hand can handle both linear and non-linear datasets. An AE takes in all the features of an image as a node, and discards redundant features, providing an output of nodes with the most relevant features [166, 167]. Leracitano et al. (2020) employed an AE as a feature extraction to extract the most relevant features from SEM micrographs of electrospun fibres. Finding the features that are distinct between different classes of images is indeed a near-impossible task for researchers to perform manually, given the considerably large number of pixels an image can generate, and that 25 each pixel can possess a wide range of colour shades. However, this is an easy task for a well-trained AE and thus employing an Autoencoder can relieve a user of this daunting task. For their study, Leracitano et al. (2020) developed a model using 160 images and an AE to differentiate between the features obtained from images containing an undesirable bead to that of micrographs containing homogenous fibres. Following the feature extraction, ANN was used to classify the data. This two-step ML approach resulted in a classification accuracy of 92.5%, which was higher than the 80% accuracy obtained by CNN using the same sample size. The ability of ML to accommodate different data formats broadens their applicability. Table 7 provides a summary of the advantages of ML algorithms, as well as their drawbacks. Table 7. A summary of the advantages and drawbacks of ML algorithms.

The ability to distinguish between the Taylor cone jet modes can help towards building a reliable 26 automated monitoring system, particularly for complex systems such as multi-nozzle EHD. The possibility to build ML models on relatively small datasets is indeed appealing. This has been a subject of interest to the ML community. As a response, ‘few shot’ and ‘one shot’ learning models have been developed, and they have had profound benefits across a number of disciplines [168, 169]. As the name suggests, such models require either a few or one, respectively, samples to develop a model. Hence, researchers in EHD have several ML options available, depending on their constraints. Needless to say, the use of ML image classification remains nascent, and there is opportunity to explore other imaging modalities, such as x-ray microtomography, transmission electron microscopy, and hyperspectral images [170-173]. In the past decade, with the increasing knowledge in the area of nanotechnology, there is a widespread demand in the use of simple, versatile and cost-effective processing techniques for the fabrication of nanostructures. EHD process has recently drawn an enormous attention due to its capability to produce products in nano to micron- size range from various types of raw materials. The successful commercialisation and FDA approval of a number of nanofiber products produced by electrospinning, and the great potential in the development of novel polymeric nano/microparticles from the related electrospraying process, should drive extensive efforts in the advancement into the field to improve the EHD process monitoring and control. Despite numerous studies developing theoretical models and simulations for better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the process of EHD, large-scale production of micro/nano features from this technique is still hindered by the complex behaviour of the electrified jets and lack of predictive models that encompass a plethora of process parameters. Whilst EHD process exhibits high flexibility towards processing of a variety of materials with multiple functionalities through co-axial and multi-axial technologies, there is still a strong need to address issues concerning large-volume processing as well as accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, translation of the EHD process to industry requires the know-how and multidisciplinary knowledge by the operators and users of the equipment. With the aid of the state-of-the-art predictive models such as ML, the key EHD process parameters as well as the overall EHD workflow can be regulated to achieve a more sustainable manufacturing process in the near future. ML can facilitate process monitoring and quality control through in-line systems and automation. The EHD process can become more intelligent and efficient through integration with ML, reducing the production time and enhancing the product quality. As discussed in this review, so far, there has only been a few attempts to develop ML algorithms in the EHD process workflow. Notwithstanding, continuous research efforts are still required to develop more accurate ML models to allow improvements in the current EHD technologies. It is evident that the industry is undergoing a paradigm shift with engineering principals and product-process design guiding manufacturing. Further developments in ML for the EHD process can eventually transform this technology and its products toward commercialisation. Ultimately, EHD processes have the potential to address gaps in healthcare research. Further work is needed to refine the EHD processes, particularly to advance EHD processes that can develop 3D products. Here, ML will be required to help expedite the formulation development stage of advanced EHD processes, and to minimise the empirical trial-and-error methodology 27 that will not yield sustainable research in the future. The application of ML for EHD processes is beginning to garner interest, however, a cross-disciplinary workforce encompassing ML practitioners, informaticians and EHD researchers, will be needed to harness the prospect of ML for EHD processes.

This paper provides an analysis of the way in which two foundationalprinciples of medical ethics–the trusted doctor and patient autonomy–can be under-mined by the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and addresses its legal sig-nificance.

ML models result from ‘learning’,broadly understood, on large amounts of data. This learning process determines what themodel will be able to predict. Given this, a ML model becomes the basis for predictionsabout features that were in the data from which it ‘learned’. For example, a ML modelthat is trained with cardiograms can ‘learn’ to predict which cardiogram is associatedwith heart disease, but may not ’learn’ what a healthy heart rate is.ML can be used in any domain of inquiry where large amounts of data can be found,including, but not limited to, all aspects of healthcare. This development can be attributedto two independent factors: an increase in the availability of large health-related datasets,on the one hand, and a decrease in the expense of the computationally intensive learn-ing process, on the other. As central processing units in computers become cheaper andfaster, it takes less time and energy to generate a useful and accurate ML model.Non-ML statistical modelling techniques used in healthcare can and often are usedto enable interpretations of data and to provide a basis for causal inference. The mainreason for this is that researchers can validate their interpretations of data by, for exam-0Copyright c© 2019 for this paper by its authors.

For example, a correlational model of cardiograms of people withand without heart disease may tell researchers which features are relevant and significantin contributing to its predictions. This is typically not something we can or even want todo with ML models. The notion of statistical significance has little place in making senseof why a particular ML model makes predictions the way it does.In sum, ML is limited to those domains that can provide an adequately large and richdataset. The use of ML, however, comes with a trade-off. Typically an increased accuracyof prediction coincides with a simultaneous increase in the opaqueness of the factors thatcome to play a role in that accuracy. This means that robust ML models are unlikely to tellus much about the factors, variables, patterns, and relationships that are responsible forthe predictions that the model makes. There is ongoing research [2], [3] into making MLmodels interpretable and explainable, which, if successful, could be a straightforwardway to resolve the trade-off. Until that time comes, however, this particular feature ofML raises significant ethical and legal concerns within the healthcare domain, especiallyin contexts where transparency and explainability play a foundational role.In this paper, we focus on two moral foundations that are especially important in thehealthcare domain: the position of the trusted doctor and respect for patient autonomy.We focus on these two issues because they connect most obviously to established legalframeworks within which healthcare professionals typically operate. Since obligations ofmedicine are importantly distinct from the obligations of everyday morality, we ignorethe more general issues connected to the explainability of ML. In section 1 we providea brief review of the legal and ethical foundations of the notions of a trusted doctorand patient autonomy. In section 2 we take up the moral and legal difficulties that MLgenerates for the trust in doctors and patient autonomy. In section 3 we sketch some ofthe methods that can be used to mitigate the problems we discuss in section 2.1. The Reasonable Physician and Patient Standards in the Law and MedicalEthicsIdealizations play an important role in common law. For example, when the issue underconsideration is someone’s intent, one way in which the law sees it being determined isby examining the understanding of an idealized reasonable person. During this process,consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case to determine what a rea-sonable person would intend or do in these circumstances. Similar idealizations are usedin the medical context to determine whether there was informed consent and to ascertainliabilty. It is an issue of ongoing debate in the ethics and law of medicine precisely whichpieces of information must be disclosed to patients in order to fulfill this commitment totruth-telling and subsequently to avoid allegations of medical malpractice [4]–[6]. Somematters are uncontroversial, for example, the most common and most serious risks ofundergoing or forgoing a treatment must be disclosed and explained. But it is practi-cally impossible and probably ethically undesirable to disclose all relevant informationto patients before they make a medical decision.In the U.S. two different legal and ethical standards dictate which information mustbe disclosed to a patient in order for them to give informed consent to medical inter-ventions or participate in clinical research: the reasonable physician (medical practiceor professional) standard and the reasonable patient (or person) standard [7], [8]. Thesetwo standards provide different answers to the question: ’what information must be pro-vided to a patient before they are capable of giving truly informed consent?’ The rea-sonable physician standard answers it by referring to the broadly accepted professionalstandards and practices relevant to the specific context. The reasonable patient standardanswers it by referencing what an average patient would want to know, find relevant totheir decision making, or be expected to be informed about.In the context of informed consent to interventions or treatments, the reasonablephysician and reasonable patient standards create distinct challenges. The reasonablepatient standard generates problems connected to it being vague, since it assumes thatpatients across demographic groups are sufficiently similar. This notion does not relyon empirical evidence regarding patient preferences or expectations, so it is sometimesdifficult to imagine what the idealized person would want or expect to know about theirdiagnosis. The problems with the reasonable physician standard are slightly different.The standards of medical practice and thus what can be expected from a reasonablephysician is not constant over time or place, so what is expected of a physician is highlydependant on context.For example, in the United States for at least four decades there was professionalconsensus that, with rare exceptions, competent patients must be informed of their diag-nosis, if they wish to be. But a study in 1961 revealed that a vast majority of physiciansroutinely witheld cancer diagnosis from patients [9]. Practice does not always follow thestandards set out by idealizations. A second shortcoming of this standard is that even ahigh percentage of professional physicians can be mistaken, biased, or unaware, whenit comes to information that is relevant to patient decision making. This is unfortunate,since the physician has to determine which information to provide to patients before ask-ing them to decide on treatment or care. It is in these sorts of situations that the notionof a reasonable physician is used when U.S. courts need to determine whether the physi-cian satisfied standards of informed consent. Informed consent, which we turn to later,is crucial to determine negligence and malpractice. A physician that did not abide by thestandard of informed consent may be liable.The reasonable physician standard is used differently in other common law tradi-tions, such as U.K. and Canada, and significantly different in civil law contexts. For ex-ample, in Canada (except Quebec), doctors are legally required to answer all questionsposed by patients, including about benefits, risks, and treatment alternatives. In Aus-tralia, the professional does not incur a liability in negligence, if it is established that ”theprofessional acted in a manner that at the time the service was provided was widely ac-cepted by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice” (Civil LibertiesAct of 2002, Section 5O). In the U.K., these issues are typically resolved be referring thetort standard embodied in the Bolam Standard. On this standard, ”a doctor is not guiltyof negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a re-sponsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art” (Bolam v Friern HospitalManagement Committee [1957] 1 WLR 583). All of these common law standards are, tosome extent, idealizations of what a reasonable physician is expected to do, even thoughtheir practical and legal bases are different. In the civil law tradition, we have examplessuch as the la responsabilite civile (Code of Ethics of Physicians) in France, which is un-equivocal in demanding that ”a doctor must in all circumstances be trustworthy and actwith integrity and devotion to duty, essential for the practice of medicine. Confidentialityis a patient’s right. It is mandatory for all doctors as required by law” (Articles R.4127-3and R.4127-4).Zooming out from nation-specific legal instruments to the international level, themedical profession has distinct mention in the 1948-2017 Declaration of Geneva, in the1964 Declaration of Helsinki, as well in the 1997 Council of Europe Convention on Hu-man Rights and Biomedicine, among others. Arguably, these international instruments,like their nation-specific counterparts, embody at least in spirit two closely related foun-dational principles of medical ethics: the trusted doctor [10], [11] and respect for pa-tient autonomy, which is closely related to truth-telling and informed consent [12], [13].Violating these two ethical principles will be, in many cases, also a violation of relatednation-specific and international legal standards that protect medical professionals andpatients. Therefore, focusing on the way in which ML will affect these two ethical prin-ciples is a way of addressing possible legal consequences, without focusing on nation-specific and international similarities and differences across legal contexts.The trusted doctor principle is grounded in the claim that medicine has a distinctset of moral responsibilities and physicians have a fiduciary duty to their patients [10],[14]. For example, a doctor may be free to allocate attention and empathy to only thosepeople in their circle of intimates for whom they care, but in a healthcare setting theyare required to put personal preferences aside and allocate attention and care on the basisof considerations like medical need and urgency [10], [14]. This centers the physician’sobligation to earn trust and be trustworthy, as they are given a special set of rights andprivileges in society. In general, the medical notion of a patient’s trust in their doctor canbe understood as:... an attitude of willingness to rely on another person or entity to perform actions thatbenefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given sphere of activity, together witha normative expectation: the person or entity should perform in a particular way[15,p. 355].Physicians are obligated to provide care in accordance with the principle of beneficence,that is, to act for the benefit of the patient. Simultaneously, they are expected and obli-gated to act in accordance with a wide range of other moral and professional commit-ments, such as the commitment to staying up to date with respect to scientific develop-ments in their field, transparency about the limitations of their expertise, respect for pa-tient confidentiality, truth telling, and respect for patient autonomy and informed consent,broadly construed.The attitude of trust that many patients have in their physicians cannot be taken forgranted and is mediated by several factors. Research shows that patient characteristicslike race and socio-economic status impact their trust in physicians (c.f. Kennedy, Mathisand Woods 2007 on urban African Americans trust in the health care system) as cancharacteristics of the physician or the institutions they are embedded in. Patients whobelieve that their physicians are being compensated based on the number of medical teststhey request or prescriptions they write in a managed care system are (unsurprisingly)seen as less trustworthy [16]. The introduction of new technologies in medical practiceis not by any means a novel phenomenon and how new technologies impact patient trustis a perennial issue [17]. For example, Promberger and Baron [18] found that patientshave greater trust in and are more likely to follow medical recommendations provided tothem by a physician rather than by a computer.The other foundational moral commitment of medicine that is embodied in legalinstruments and that we discuss here is patient autonomy, which includes the interrelatedethical principles of truth-telling and informed consent [12], [13]. Informed consent iscentral to many of legal instruments discussed already, but it also has a special placewithin medical ethics, especially when coupled with respect for patient autonomy onwhich it arguably depends. One way in which requirement of respect for autonomy or,more broadly, respect for persons, is operationalized in the medical context is through therequirement that physicians obtain consent or refusal for any medical intervention theyconsider from the patient, assuming that the patient has decisional capacity. The closelyrelated legal concept of patient competence is determined on the basis of four criterion[19], [20]. When making a medical decision patients must be able 1) ”communicatea choice;” 2) ”Understand the relevant information;” 3) ”Appreciate the situation andits consequences;” and 4) ”Reason about treatment options” [19, p. 1836]. In order forpatients to be able to demonstrate these capacities physicians must provide them with therelevant information in a form that the patient is able to understand and then follow upwith an assessment of their understanding through the use of specific questions, such as:”Why do you think your doctor has [or I have] recommended this treatment?” (Ibid p.1836).Respect for autonomy requires that patients have the opportunity to make their ownmedical decisions which are consistent with their own values, preferences, and under-standing of a good life, even when these decisions may conflict with what others, in-cluding the medical team, see as in their best interests. Given this, most major medicalinterventions require that the patient be given adequate and truthful information aboutthe risks, benefits, and alternative treatments and be given opportunity to discuss andask questions about their treatment. This means that the requirements of truth-telling andinformed consent are to some extent derivative from the requirement of respect for indi-vidual autonomy–hence the aforementioned inter-relatedness of these principles. Truth-telling in medicine makes it possible for patients to be able to make their own decisionsabout matters of their health care. Deception in medicine is a form of expressing a lack ofrespect for the rationality and autonomy of the patient, which interferes with a patient’sability to exercise his or her decisional capacity.2. The Effect of ML on the Trusted Doctor and Patient Autonomy PrinciplesA crucial question for the ethical use of ML in medicine is whether or not patients’ at-titude of trust will be undermined as it becomes difficult or impossible to explain to thepatient or their family member what lies behind a diagnosis or recommendation of courseof treatment. And once this question is answered, we also need to answer a follow-upquestion: Will the special set of rights and privileges that medical professionals are en-dowed with on the basis of that trust appear unwarranted from the patient’s perspectiveas a result? Two considerations suggest that such a situation is likely and that the useof ML in medicine may undermine patient trust. The first has to do with responsibil-ity/explainability and the second to do with perceived objectivity/bias.To maintain trust physicians must be able to unpack their diagnoses and recommen-dations in lay person’s terms and create a shared understanding of the medical facts. Thisallows patients to make informed and autonomous decisions about the course of theircare. Simultaneously, it is during this process that patient and physician take shared re-sponsibility for the course of care [21]. In order for trust to be maintained physiciansmust be able to explain the role that ML-models or algorithms played in the diagnosis orrecommendation. They must also communicate and be justified in communicating thatthe doctor is ultimately responsible for a patient’s evaluation or care, despite the role ofa black-box algorithm. If this is not possible, in time the trust that governs the doctor-patient relationship will be undermined and the expectations that patients have of theirdoctors will be changed. There is now significant evidence that trust is indeed under-mined by computer systems in the medical context, if such explanations are not provided[22]. ML-models will similarly be unable aid patients in a way that keeps them informedin the ethically significant sense.Second, physicians are expected to treat their patients with nonjudgmental regardand in a manner free from personal bias [23]. This is not easily accomplished by physi-cians and there is significant evidence that they fail to live up to this obligation whentreating, for example, patients with eating disorders [24] or patients who are obese [25].Although physicians are imperfect in setting aside biases and personal preferences whendelivering care, they are bound by a moral duty to strive to do so. If physicians fail toprevent their biases from impacting their perceptions and treatment of their patients, theexpanded use of diagnostic and treatment recommending technology seems like an ap-pealing way to ameliorate this problem. Machines are, after all, objective, their resultsfree from interpretation and associated human frailties, one might think.This sort of techno-optimism is potentially problematic because, somewhat fa-mously now, ML algorithms can themselves become biased in a variety of ways [26]–[28]. We already now know cases of ML algorithms in healthcare that turned out to bebiased [29]–[31]. From the perspective of clinical justice this is a problem in and of itselfthat is likely to compound preexisting physician biases, rather than counteract them. Asthe existence of bias in ML-aided healthcare becomes widely known there is a furtherrisk that patient trust in its recommendations will also be undermined. This presents atroubling dilemma for the project of maintaining the trusted doctor standards. To discloseto patients the extent to which ML-aided healthcare is subject to bias undermines trust inthe system as a whole, but to fail to disclose these limitations may violate the obligationsof truth telling and robust informed consent.The legal consequences of undermining the trusted doctor standard must be care-fully considered and this is outside the scope of the present article. Regarless, we canhere at least focus on the legal basis for the final word in diagnosis and treatment rec-ommendations, which lies with medical professionals precisely because of the privilegedepistemic and moral position that they have within that domain. When the epistemic andmoral bases for that position are undermined, we can expect the legal basis to be sim-ilarly undermined in time. Someone that does not or cannot fulfill an obligation to dosomething, eventually is relieved of that obligation, all things being equal. This in turnwould pose a fundamental challenge to medical moral responsibility and to the way thatthe legal system deals with malpractice, patient death, and liability in cases of disagree-ment among medical professionals. In all of these cases, the medical professional’s au-thority and protection under law will be diminished or disappear altogether, as a resultof the diminishing of the expectations on their performing their duty to explain thingsto patients. The remaining question would be then to assign responsibility to someonewhen things go awry.It is worthwhile noting here that there are related discussions of the ways in whichthe introduction of ML into new spheres of human activity (e.g. self driving cars, surgicalrobots, or automated loan eligibility assessment) impacts responsibility attribution [32]–[35]. Troubles with assigning responsibility in a world full of automation and ML is notunique to healthcare. In those other domains the question of who to blame when thingsgo awry is far from being solved. We can also expect medical professionals to be putin an uncomfortable position to have to justify their diagnoses or treatment decisionsin cases where they themselves cannot state reasons or explain the performance of anML algorithm. At best, medical professionals will have to offer post hoc rationalizationsthat the performance of the ML model is in line with what they would have decidedindependently as an appropriate course of action themselves.Similarly to the requirement of the trusted doctor, it is difficult to fulfill the patientautonomy requirement, if the answers to questions about treatment or diagnosis are inprinciple difficult or altogether impossible to give. To see this consider a medical pro-fessional that answers questions about the risks and benefits of treatment with only pre-dictions of success or failure, rather than with reasons why these predictions are as lowor high as they are. A patient that asks for such reasons and does not get answers willnot be in a position to have informed consent to the treatment. Similarly, a medical pro-fessional that fails to answer questions about alternative treatments would be failing torespect patient autonomy. That choice is effectively not given to the patient. Finally, amedical professional that cannot or will not discuss possible manners of treatment, butmerely provides a recommendation, will be violating the requirement of truth-telling. Anopaque ML-aided algorithm that recommends or diagnoses in healthcare will be just likethat medical professional, unable to provide answers to questions about risks and ben-efits, reasons for predictions, or alternative treatments. This situation threatens respectfor patient autonomy by effectively removing a patient’s decisional capacity from thecalculus that determines courses of treatment and care.Removing patient decisions from that calculus can be legally significant. In Canada,for example, doctors are legally required to answer all questions posed by patients, in-cluding about benefits, risks, and treatment alternatives. Similar laws can be found in theEuropean Union and the United States. It is simply not clear how these legal require-ments of informed consent doctrines can be met in good faith when ML-aided health-care interventions or diagnoses are involved. Medical professionals cannot be expectedto understand the operation of an ML-model when they are in principle opaque, evento the computer scientists that may be ’teaching’ them to recognize patterns. Again, atbest, medical professionals can offer post hoc rationalizations of the operation of theML-model, assuming that it is doing what they would do, but without ever knowing thatit actually does so.The legal consequences of undermining patient autonomy, as with the trusted doctorstandard, are likely to be profound. The professional and legal obligations that doctorshave with respect to patients will likely come under pressure. In a legal context, a doc-tor’s answer to a patient’s question that cites the opaqueness of an ML model may be inviolation of the requirements of informed consent, effectively putting in question a diag-nosis that is responsible for a possible later mistake or simply by ignoring what a patientmay find particularly important in their medical situation. Again, an answer that simplyassumes that the ML model is doing what a doctor would do is a misrepresentation thatmay itself be in violation of the legal standard for evidence. Evidence that, say, a doctorprovided informed consent in a way ’I-know-not-how’ is setting the bar for admissibilityextremely low.To sum up, the two foundational principles of medical ethics, the trusted doctor andpatient autonomy, are undermined by the opaqueness of ML-aided medicine. If theseprinciples are undermined, then we can expect significant downstream conflicts withinternational and nation-specific legal standards that govern the the medical profession.In particular, the legal basis for informed consent, liability, and standard of malpracticewill be out of sync with the reality of day-to-day doctor-patient interactions. Physicianswill not be in a position to live up to the standards of the trusted doctor standard thatis required of them to secure authority in diagnosis and consent. Furthermore, patientswill have their autonomy challenged by physicians that are either unable to tell themthe actual basis for diagnoses or treatment recommendations or will outright misinformthem about that basis. The remaining question is how to deal with these consequences,especially since ML-aided medicine is already here.3. Three Ways Forward for Machine Learning in HealthcareUsing ML in a medical setting is bound to have a positive effect in a number of areas, in-cluding effectiveness of diagnostics, decreases in cost, and better resource management.These positives are in danger of being outweighed by the negative consequences thatarise from the nature of ML technology and the downstream effects of its widespreaduse. Among these is the already mentioned lack of transparency inherent in ML models,but also the use of massive amounts of private data to ‘teach’ ML models, and finallythe possible introduction of biases into the predictions that ML models make. Here wediscuss three ways of resolving problems caused by the lack of transparency, withoutaddressing these other potential problems: (1) saliency methods, (2) limiting the role ofML to specific domains of healthcare where its lack of explainability does not undermineethical foundations or legal norms, or (3) changing the reasonable patient and reasonablephysician standards. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.1) Saliency methods analyze a ML model that has already ’learned’ to recognizepatterns in an image by piecemeal subtracting parts of an image until the part most rel-evant to the classification and/or prediction is found. This process can be repeated toobtain a ranking of parts of an image that can then comprise something very close toan explanation as to why the image was classified in the way that it was. At that point,medical professionals can also provide something like reasons to the diagnosis that arebased on the ranking, if asked to do so by the patient. Saliency methods for generatingexplainable ML models may work whenever images are involved. This is by no meansexhaustive of the possible ways in which ML diagnostics can be made explainable, butis the one that most obviously connects to healthcare diagnostics that use images.There are two problems with the saliency approach. First, it is not generalizable toall areas of healthcare and specifically to those that do not rely on images. Cardiograms,X-rays, MRIs, or just photographs may all be essential for diagnosis, but they are notalways relevant to the recommendations that a medical professional ultimately makeswith respect to treatment or care. There are also a variety of diagnostics that do notrely on imagining. Second, saliency has recently come under pressure as a method ofexplaining the performance of ML [36]. It turns out that that two distinct ML models mayperform identically under the same conditions, which would likely generate disparateexplanations via saliency for the same performance. What this means, is that explanationsvia saliency can be a dime a dozen, depending on the model that happens to be used–not something that a patient or doctor are likely to accept as an accaptable standard ofexplainability.(2) The most drastic option and perhaps also the easiest way to deal with the prob-lems of ML in context of healthcare is to advocate for strict legal regulations both at a na-tional level and internationally. In cases where the use of ML may directly undermine thedoctor-patient relationship or undermine legal standards for informed consent, it shouldnot be used, full stop. One good example of a context where such a limitation may beparticularly important is in diagnostic algorithms that take disparate data about a largenumber of people and construct a model that can predict the presence of early stages ofa chronic degenerative disease, such as Alzheimer’s Disease or multiple sclerosis. Whileundoubtedly such a tool could be useful in a non-clinical setting to nudge people to seekphysician-assisted diagnosis, it should under no circumstances be used instead of sucha diagnosis or in conjunction with it. Doing so opens up a slew of moral and legal dif-ficulties, not limited to those outlined in the two sections above. The main problem ofthe regulative approach is that enforcement of laws that regulate ML-aided medicine islikely to be extremely difficult internationally, especially in an era of medical tourism.3) The third option is to reassess and change the reasonable patient and reasonabledoctor standards in such a way that the idealization that are based on them are sensi-tive to the advent of ML-aided medicine. We cannot offer speculations about what thesechanges could entail–this is work for legal scholars working within specific legal con-texts. However, this article sketches what we hope are useful guidelines and framingconditions that such speculations could follow. First, the reasonable doctor cannot be ex-pected to explain the actual basis of an ML-aided advice and a reasonable patient cannotexpect to receive such information from their physician. Second, attempts by physiciansto justify ML-based advice or diagnoses on the basis of what they assume they wouldhave done themselves are dangerous and should be avoided. Thirdly, patients and physi-cians should be vigilant about the potential biases that are at the heart of the diagnosesand advice provided by ML-aided medicine. Any reasonable idealization that takes intoaccount the trusted doctor standard and patient autonomy should have room for flaggingpotential hidden biases that drive ML-aided medicine, in lieu of evidence to the contrary.4.
